## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

Runway''s interface is a cinematic reel brought to life as a website — a dark, editorial, film-production-grade design where full-bleed photography and video ARE the primary UI elements. This is not a typical tech product page; it''s a visual manifesto for AI-powered creativity. Every section feels like a frame from a film: dramatic lighting, sweeping landscapes, and intimate human moments captured in high-quality imagery that dominates the viewport.

The design language is built on a single typeface — abcNormal — a clean, geometric sans-serif that handles everything from 48px display headlines to 11px uppercase labels. This single-font commitment creates an extreme typographic uniformity that lets the visual content speak louder than the text. Headlines use tight line-heights (1.0) with negative letter-spacing (-0.9px to -1.2px), creating compressed text blocks that feel like film titles rather than marketing copy.

What makes Runway distinctive is its complete commitment to visual content as design. Rather than illustrating features with icons or diagrams, Runway shows actual AI-generated and AI-enhanced imagery — cars driving through cinematic landscapes, artistic portraits, architectural renders. The interface itself retreats into near-invisibility: minimal borders, zero shadows, subtle cool-gray text, and a dark palette that puts maximum focus on the photography.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Cinematic full-bleed photography and video as primary UI elements
- Single typeface system: abcNormal for everything from display to micro labels
- Dark-dominant palette with cool-toned neutrals (#767d88, #7d848e)
- Zero shadows, minimal borders — the interface is intentionally invisible
- Tight display typography (line-height 1.0) with negative tracking (-0.9px to -1.2px)
- Uppercase labels with positive letter-spacing for navigational structure
- Weight 450 (unusual intermediate) for small uppercase text — precision craft
- Editorial magazine layout with mixed-size image grids

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

### Primary
- **Runway Black** (`#000000`): The primary page background and maximum-emphasis text.
- **Deep Black** (`#030303`): A near-imperceptible variant for layered dark surfaces.
- **Dark Surface** (`#1a1a1a`): Card backgrounds and elevated dark containers.
- **Pure White** (`#ffffff`): Primary text on dark surfaces and light-section backgrounds.

### Surface & Background
- **Near White** (`#fefefe`): The lightest surface — barely distinguishable from pure white.
- **Cool Cloud** (`#e9ecf2`): Light section backgrounds with a cool blue-gray tint.
- **Border Dark** (`#27272a`): The single dark-mode border color — barely visible containment.

### Neutrals & Text
- **Charcoal** (`#404040`): Primary body text on light surfaces and secondary text.
- **Near Charcoal** (`#3f3f3f`): Slightly lighter variant for dark-section secondary text.
- **Cool Slate** (`#767d88`): Secondary body text — a distinctly blue-gray cool neutral.
- **Mid Slate** (`#7d848e`): Tertiary text, metadata descriptions.
- **Muted Gray** (`#a7a7a7`): De-emphasized content, timestamps.
- **Cool Silver** (`#c9ccd1`): Light borders and dividers.
- **Light Silver** (`#d0d4d4`): The lightest border/divider variant.
- **Tailwind Gray** (`#6b7280`): Standard Tailwind neutral for supplementary text.
- **Dark Link** (`#0c0c0c`): Darkest link text — nearly black.
- **Footer Gray** (`#999999`): Footer links and deeply muted content.

### Gradient System
- **None in the interface.** Visual richness comes entirely from photographic content — AI-generated and enhanced imagery provides all the color and gradient the design needs. The interface itself is intentionally colorless.

## 3. Typography Rules

### Font Family
- **Universal**: `abcNormal`, with fallback: `abcNormal Fallback`

*Note: abcNormal is a custom geometric sans-serif. For external implementations, Inter or DM Sans serve as close substitutes.*

### Hierarchy

| Role | Font | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Notes |
|------|------|------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Display / Hero | abcNormal | 48px (3rem) | 400 | 1.00 (tight) | -1.2px | Maximum size, film-title presence |
| Section Heading | abcNormal | 40px (2.5rem) | 400 | 1.00–1.10 | -1px to 0px | Feature section titles |
| Sub-heading | abcNormal | 36px (2.25rem) | 400 | 1.00 (tight) | -0.9px | Secondary section markers |
| Card Title | abcNormal | 24px (1.5rem) | 400 | 1.00 (tight) | normal | Article and card headings |
| Feature Title | abcNormal | 20px (1.25rem) | 400 | 1.00 (tight) | normal | Small headings |
| Body / Button | abcNormal | 16px (1rem) | 400–600 | 1.30–1.50 | -0.16px to normal | Standard body, nav links |
| Caption / Label | abcNormal | 14px (0.88rem) | 500–600 | 1.25–1.43 | 0.35px (uppercase) | Metadata, section labels |
| Small | abcNormal | 13px (0.81rem) | 400 | 1.30 (tight) | -0.16px to -0.26px | Compact descriptions |
| Micro / Tag | abcNormal | 11px (0.69rem) | 450 | 1.30 (tight) | normal | Uppercase tags, tiny labels |

### Principles
- **One typeface, complete expression**: abcNormal handles every text role. The design achieves variety through size, weight, case, and letter-spacing rather than font-family switching.
- **Tight everywhere**: Nearly every size uses line-height 1.0–1.30 — even body text is relatively compressed. This creates a dense, editorial feel.
- **Weight 450 — the precision detail**: Some small uppercase labels use weight 450, an uncommon intermediate between regular (400) and medium (500). This micro-craft signals typographic sophistication.
- **Negative tracking as default**: Even body text uses -0.16px to -0.26px letter-spacing, keeping everything slightly tighter than default.
- **Uppercase as structure**: Labels at 14px and 11px use `text-transform: uppercase` with positive letter-spacing (0.35px) to create navigational signposts that contrast with the tight lowercase text.

## 4. Component Stylings

### Buttons
- Text: weight 600 at 14px abcNormal
- Background: likely transparent or dark, with minimal border
- Radius: small (4px) for button-like links
- The button design is extremely restrained — no heavy fills or borders detected
- Interactive elements blend into the editorial flow

### Cards & Containers
- Background: transparent or Dark Surface (`#1a1a1a`)
- Border: `1px solid #27272a` (dark mode) — barely visible containment
- Radius: small (4–8px) for functional elements; 16px for alert-style containers
- Shadow: zero — no shadows on any element
- Cards are primarily photographic — the image IS the card

### Navigation
- Minimal horizontal nav — transparent over hero content
- Logo: Runway wordmark in white/black
- Links: abcNormal at 16px, weight 400–600
- Hover: text shifts to white or higher opacity
- Extremely subtle — designed to not compete with visual content

### Image Treatment
- Full-bleed cinematic photography and video dominate
- AI-generated content shown at large scale as primary visual elements
- Mixed-size image grids creating editorial magazine layouts
- Dark overlays on hero images for text readability
- Product screenshots with subtle rounded corners (8px)

### Distinctive Components

**Cinematic Hero**
- Full-viewport image or video with text overlay
- Headline in 48px abcNormal, white on dark imagery
- The image is always cinematic quality — film-grade composition

**Research Article Cards**
- Photographic thumbnails with article titles
- Mixed-size grid layout (large feature + smaller supporting)
- Clean text overlay or below-image caption style

**Trust Bar**
- Company logos (leading organizations across industries)
- Clean, monochrome treatment
- Horizontal layout with generous spacing

**Mission Statement**
- "We are building AI to simulate the world through imagination, art and aesthetics"
- On a dark background with white text
- The emotional close — artistic and philosophical

## 5. Layout Principles

### Spacing System
- Base unit: 8px
- Scale: 4px, 6px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 20px, 24px, 28px, 32px, 48px, 64px, 78px
- Section vertical spacing: generous (48–78px)
- Component gaps: 16–24px

### Grid & Container
- Max container width: up to 1600px (cinema-wide)
- Hero: full-viewport, edge-to-edge
- Content sections: centered with generous margins
- Image grids: asymmetric, magazine-style mixed sizes
- Footer: full-width dark section

### Whitespace Philosophy
- **Cinema-grade breathing**: Large vertical gaps between sections create a scrolling experience that feels like watching scenes change.
- **Images replace whitespace**: Where other sites use empty space, Runway fills it with photography. The visual content IS the breathing room.
- **Editorial grid asymmetry**: The image grid uses intentionally varied sizes — large hero images paired with smaller supporting images, creating visual rhythm.

### Border Radius Scale
- Sharp (4px): Buttons, small interactive elements
- Subtle (6px): Links, small containers
- Comfortable (8px): Standard containers, image cards
- Generous (16px): Alert-style containers, featured elements

## 6. Depth & Elevation

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Flat (Level 0) | No shadow, no border | Everything — the dominant state |
| Bordered (Level 1) | `1px solid #27272a` | Alert containers only |
| Dark Section (Level 2) | Dark bg (#000000 / #1a1a1a) with light text | Hero, features, footer |
| Light Section (Level 3) | White/Cool Cloud bg with dark text | Content sections, research |

**Shadow Philosophy**: Runway uses **zero shadows**. This is a film-production design decision — in cinema, depth comes from lighting, focus, and composition, not drop shadows. The interface mirrors this philosophy: depth is communicated through dark/light section alternation, photographic depth-of-field, and overlay transparency — never through CSS box-shadow.

## 7. Do''s and Don''ts

### Do
- Use full-bleed cinematic photography as the primary visual element
- Use abcNormal for all text — maintain the single-typeface commitment
- Keep display line-heights at 1.0 with negative letter-spacing for film-title density
- Use the cool-gray neutral palette (#767d88, #7d848e) for secondary text
- Maintain zero shadows — depth comes from photography and section backgrounds
- Use uppercase with letter-spacing for navigational labels (14px, 0.35px spacing)
- Apply small border-radius (4–8px) — the design is NOT pill-shaped
- Let visual content (photos, videos) dominate — the UI should be invisible
- Use weight 450 for micro labels — the precision matters

### Don''t
- Don''t add decorative colors to the interface — the only color comes from photography
- Don''t use heavy borders or shadows — the interface must be nearly invisible
- Don''t use pill-shaped radius — Runway''s geometry is subtly rounded, not circular
- Don''t use bold (700+) weight — 400–600 is the full range, with 450 as a precision tool
- Don''t compete with the visual content — text overlays should be minimal and restrained
- Don''t use gradient backgrounds in the interface — gradients exist only in photography
- Don''t use more than one typeface — abcNormal handles everything
- Don''t use body line-height above 1.50 — the tight, editorial feel is core
- Don''t reduce image quality — cinematic photography IS the design

## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints
| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Mobile | <640px | Single column, stacked images, reduced hero text |
| Tablet | 640–768px | 2-column image grids begin |
| Small Desktop | 768–1024px | Standard layout |
| Desktop | 1024–1280px | Full layout, expanded hero |
| Large Desktop | 1280–1600px | Maximum cinema-width container |

### Touch Targets
- Navigation links at comfortable 16px
- Article cards serve as large touch targets
- Buttons at 14px weight 600 with adequate padding

### Collapsing Strategy
- **Navigation**: Collapses to hamburger on mobile
- **Hero**: Full-bleed maintained, text scales down
- **Image grids**: Multi-column → 2-column → single column
- **Research articles**: Feature-size cards → stacked full-width
- **Trust logos**: Horizontal scroll or reduced grid

### Image Behavior
- Cinematic images scale proportionally
- Full-bleed hero maintained across all sizes
- Image grids reflow to fewer columns
- Video content maintains aspect ratio

## 9. Agent Prompt Guide

### Quick Color Reference
- Background Dark: "Runway Black (#000000)"
- Background Light: "Pure White (#ffffff)"
- Primary Text Dark: "Charcoal (#404040)"
- Secondary Text: "Cool Slate (#767d88)"
- Muted Text: "Muted Gray (#a7a7a7)"
- Light Border: "Cool Silver (#c9ccd1)"
- Dark Border: "Border Dark (#27272a)"
- Card Surface: "Dark Surface (#1a1a1a)"

### Example Component Prompts
- "Create a cinematic hero section: full-bleed dark background with a cinematic image overlay. Headline at 48px abcNormal weight 400, line-height 1.0, letter-spacing -1.2px in white. Minimal text below in Cool Slate (#767d88) at 16px."
- "Design a research article grid: one large card (50% width) with a cinematic image and 24px title, next to two smaller cards stacked. All images with 8px border-radius. Titles in white (dark bg) or Charcoal (#404040, light bg)."
- "Build a section label: 14px abcNormal weight 500, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.35px in Cool Slate (#767d88). No border, no background."
- "Create a trust bar: company logos in monochrome, horizontal layout with generous spacing. On dark background with white/gray logo treatments."
- "Design a mission statement section: Runway Black background, white text at 36px abcNormal, line-height 1.0, letter-spacing -0.9px. Centered, with generous vertical padding."

### Iteration Guide
1. Visual content first — always include cinematic photography
2. Use abcNormal for everything — specify size and weight, never change the font
3. Keep the interface invisible — no heavy borders, no shadows, no bright colors
4. Use the cool slate grays (#767d88, #7d848e) for secondary text — not warm grays
5. Uppercase labels need letter-spacing (0.35px) — never tight uppercase
6. Dark sections should be truly dark (#000000 or #1a1a1a) — no medium grays as surfaces

### Touch Targets
- Navigation links at comfortable 16px
- Article cards serve as large touch targets
- Buttons at 14px weight 600 with adequate padding

### Collapsing Strategy
- **Navigation**: Collapses to hamburger on mobile
- **Hero**: Full-bleed maintained, text scales down
- **Image grids**: Multi-column → 2-column → single column
- **Research articles**: Feature-size cards → stacked full-width
- **Trust logos**: Horizontal scroll or reduced grid

### Image Behavior
- Cinematic images scale proportionally
- Full-bleed hero maintained across all sizes
- Image grids reflow to fewer columns
- Video content maintains aspect ratio', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/runwayml/DESIGN.md","category":"responsive_guidelines"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 9),

### Quick Color Reference
- Background Dark: "Runway Black (#000000)"
- Background Light: "Pure White (#ffffff)"
- Primary Text Dark: "Charcoal (#404040)"
- Secondary Text: "Cool Slate (#767d88)"
- Muted Text: "Muted Gray (#a7a7a7)"
- Light Border: "Cool Silver (#c9ccd1)"
- Dark Border: "Border Dark (#27272a)"
- Card Surface: "Dark Surface (#1a1a1a)"

### Example Component Prompts
- "Create a cinematic hero section: full-bleed dark background with a cinematic image overlay. Headline at 48px abcNormal weight 400, line-height 1.0, letter-spacing -1.2px in white. Minimal text below in Cool Slate (#767d88) at 16px."
- "Design a research article grid: one large card (50% width) with a cinematic image and 24px title, next to two smaller cards stacked. All images with 8px border-radius. Titles in white (dark bg) or Charcoal (#404040, light bg)."
- "Build a section label: 14px abcNormal weight 500, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.35px in Cool Slate (#767d88). No border, no background."
- "Create a trust bar: company logos in monochrome, horizontal layout with generous spacing. On dark background with white/gray logo treatments."
- "Design a mission statement section: Runway Black background, white text at 36px abcNormal, line-height 1.0, letter-spacing -0.9px. Centered, with generous vertical padding."

### Iteration Guide
1. Visual content first — always include cinematic photography
2. Use abcNormal for everything — specify size and weight, never change the font
3. Keep the interface invisible — no heavy borders, no shadows, no bright colors
4. Use the cool slate grays (#767d88, #7d848e) for secondary text — not warm grays
5. Uppercase labels need letter-spacing (0.35px) — never tight uppercase
6. Dark sections should be truly dark (#000000 or #1a1a1a) — no medium grays as surfaces', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/runwayml/DESIGN.md","category":"other"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 10);

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

Sanity''s website is a developer-content platform rendered as a nocturnal command center -- dark, precise, and deeply structured. The entire experience sits on a near-black canvas (`#0b0b0b`) that reads less like a "dark mode toggle" and more like the natural state of a tool built for people who live in terminals. Where most CMS marketing pages reach for friendly pastels and soft illustration, Sanity leans into the gravity of its own product: structured content deserves a structured stage.

The signature typographic voice is waldenburgNormal -- a distinctive, slightly geometric sans-serif with tight negative letter-spacing (-0.32px to -4.48px at display sizes) that gives headlines a compressed, engineered quality. At 112px hero scale with -4.48px tracking, the type feels almost machined -- like precision-cut steel letterforms. This is paired with IBM Plex Mono for code and technical labels, creating a dual-register voice: editorial authority meets developer credibility.

What makes Sanity distinctive is the interplay between its monochromatic dark palette and vivid, saturated accent punctuation. The neutral scale runs from pure black through a tightly controlled gray ramp (`#0b0b0b` -> `#212121` -> `#353535` -> `#797979` -> `#b9b9b9` -> `#ededed` -> `#ffffff`) with no warm or cool bias -- just pure, achromatic precision. Against this disciplined backdrop, a neon green accent (display-p3 green) and electric blue (`#0052ef`) land with the impact of signal lights in a dark control room. The orange-red CTA (`#f36458`) provides the only warm touch in an otherwise cool system.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Near-black canvas (`#0b0b0b`) as the default, natural environment -- not a dark "mode" but the primary identity
- waldenburgNormal with extreme negative tracking at display sizes, creating a precision-engineered typographic voice
- Pure achromatic gray scale -- no warm or cool undertones, pure neutral discipline
- Vivid accent punctuation: neon green, electric blue (`#0052ef`), and coral-red (`#f36458`) against the dark field
- Pill-shaped primary buttons (99999px radius) contrasting with subtle rounded rectangles (3-6px) for secondary actions
- IBM Plex Mono as the technical counterweight to the editorial display face
- Full-bleed dark sections with content contained in measured max-width containers
- Hover states that shift to electric blue (`#0052ef`) across all interactive elements -- a consistent "activation" signal

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

### Primary Brand
- **Sanity Black** (`#0b0b0b`): The primary canvas and dominant surface color. Not pure black but close enough to feel absolute. The foundation of the entire visual identity.
- **Pure Black** (`#000000`): Used for maximum-contrast moments, deep overlays, and certain border accents.
- **Sanity Red** (`#f36458`): The primary CTA and brand accent -- a warm coral-red that serves as the main call-to-action color. Used for "Get Started" buttons and primary conversion points.

### Accent & Interactive
- **Electric Blue** (`#0052ef`): The universal hover/active state color across the entire system. Buttons, links, and interactive elements all shift to this blue on hover. Also used as `--color-blue-700` for focus rings and active states.
- **Light Blue** (`#55beff` / `#afe3ff`): Secondary blue variants used for accent backgrounds, badges, and dimmed blue surfaces.
- **Neon Green** (`color(display-p3 .270588 1 0)`): A vivid, wide-gamut green used as `--color-fg-accent-green` for success states and premium feature highlights. Falls back to `#19d600` in sRGB.
- **Accent Magenta** (`color(display-p3 .960784 0 1)`): A vivid wide-gamut magenta for specialized accent moments.

### Surface & Background
- **Near Black** (`#0b0b0b`): Default page background and primary surface.
- **Dark Gray** (`#212121`): Elevated surface color for cards, secondary containers, input backgrounds, and subtle layering above the base canvas.
- **Medium Dark** (`#353535`): Tertiary surface and border color for creating depth between dark layers.
- **Pure White** (`#ffffff`): Used for inverted sections, light-on-dark text, and specific button surfaces.
- **Light Gray** (`#ededed`): Light surface for inverted/light sections and subtle background tints.

### Neutrals & Text
- **White** (`#ffffff`): Primary text color on dark surfaces, maximum legibility.
- **Silver** (`#b9b9b9`): Secondary text, body copy on dark surfaces, muted descriptions, and placeholder text.
- **Medium Gray** (`#797979`): Tertiary text, metadata, timestamps, and de-emphasized content.
- **Charcoal** (`#212121`): Text on light/inverted surfaces.
- **Near Black Text** (`#0b0b0b`): Primary text on white/light button surfaces.

### Semantic
- **Error Red** (`#dd0000`): Destructive actions, validation errors, and critical warnings -- a pure, high-saturation red.
- **GPC Green** (`#37cd84`): Privacy/compliance indicator green.
- **Focus Ring Blue** (`#0052ef`): Focus ring color for accessibility, matching the interactive blue.

### Border System
- **Dark Border** (`#0b0b0b`): Primary border on dark containers -- barely visible, maintaining minimal containment.
- **Subtle Border** (`#212121`): Standard border for inputs, textareas, and card edges on dark surfaces.
- **Medium Border** (`#353535`): More visible borders for emphasized containment and dividers.
- **Light Border** (`#ffffff`): Border on inverted/light elements or buttons needing contrast separation.
- **Orange Border** (`color(display-p3 1 0.3333 0)`): Special accent border for highlighted/featured elements.

## 3. Typography Rules

### Font Family
- **Display / Headline**: `waldenburgNormal`, fallback: `waldenburgNormal Fallback, ui-sans-serif, system-ui`
- **Body / UI**: `waldenburgNormal`, fallback: `waldenburgNormal Fallback, ui-sans-serif, system-ui`
- **Code / Technical**: `IBM Plex Mono`, fallback: `ibmPlexMono Fallback, ui-monospace`
- **Fallback / CJK**: `Helvetica`, fallback: `Arial, Hiragino Sans GB, STXihei, Microsoft YaHei, WenQuanYi Micro Hei`

*Note: waldenburgNormal is a custom typeface. For external implementations, use Inter or Space Grotesk as the sans substitute (geometric, slightly condensed feel). IBM Plex Mono is available on Google Fonts.*

### Hierarchy

| Role | Font | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Notes |
|------|------|------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Display / Hero | waldenburgNormal | 112px (7rem) | 400 | 1.00 (tight) | -4.48px | Maximum impact, compressed tracking |
| Hero Secondary | waldenburgNormal | 72px (4.5rem) | 400 | 1.05 (tight) | -2.88px | Large section headers |
| Section Heading | waldenburgNormal | 48px (3rem) | 400 | 1.08 (tight) | -1.68px | Primary section anchors |
| Heading Large | waldenburgNormal | 38px (2.38rem) | 400 | 1.10 (tight) | -1.14px | Feature section titles |
| Heading Medium | waldenburgNormal | 32px (2rem) | 425 | 1.24 (tight) | -0.32px | Card titles, subsection headers |
| Heading Small | waldenburgNormal | 24px (1.5rem) | 425 | 1.24 (tight) | -0.24px | Smaller feature headings |
| Subheading | waldenburgNormal | 20px (1.25rem) | 425 | 1.13 (tight) | -0.2px | Sub-section markers |
| Body Large | waldenburgNormal | 18px (1.13rem) | 400 | 1.50 | -0.18px | Intro paragraphs, descriptions |
| Body | waldenburgNormal | 16px (1rem) | 400 | 1.50 | normal | Standard body text |
| Body Small | waldenburgNormal | 15px (0.94rem) | 400 | 1.50 | -0.15px | Compact body text |
| Caption | waldenburgNormal | 13px (0.81rem) | 400-500 | 1.30-1.50 | -0.13px | Metadata, descriptions, tags |
| Small Caption | waldenburgNormal | 12px (0.75rem) | 400 | 1.50 | -0.12px | Footnotes, timestamps |
| Micro / Label | waldenburgNormal | 11px (0.69rem) | 500-600 | 1.00-1.50 | normal | Uppercase labels, tiny badges |
| Code Body | IBM Plex Mono | 15px (0.94rem) | 400 | 1.50 | normal | Code blocks, technical content |
| Code Caption | IBM Plex Mono | 13px (0.81rem) | 400-500 | 1.30-1.50 | normal | Inline code, small technical labels |
| Code Micro | IBM Plex Mono | 10-12px | 400 | 1.30-1.50 | normal | Tiny code labels, uppercase tags |

### Principles
- **Extreme negative tracking at scale**: Display headings at 72px+ use aggressive negative letter-spacing (-2.88px to -4.48px), creating a tight, engineered quality that distinguishes Sanity from looser editorial typography.
- **Single font, multiple registers**: waldenburgNormal handles both editorial display and functional UI text. The weight range is narrow (400-425 for most, 500-600 only for tiny labels), keeping the voice consistent.
- **OpenType feature control**: Typography uses deliberate feature settings including `"cv01", "cv11", "cv12", "cv13", "ss07"` for display sizes and `"calt" 0` for body text, fine-tuning character alternates for different contexts.
- **Tight headings, relaxed body**: Headings use 1.00-1.24 line-height (extremely tight), while body text breathes at 1.50. This contrast creates clear visual hierarchy.
- **Uppercase for technical labels**: IBM Plex Mono captions and small labels frequently use `text-transform: uppercase` with tight line-heights, creating a "system readout" aesthetic for technical metadata.

## 5. Layout Principles

### Spacing System
Base unit: **8px**

| Token | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| space-1 | 1px | Hairline gaps, border-like spacing |
| space-2 | 2px | Minimal internal padding |
| space-3 | 4px | Tight component internal spacing |
| space-4 | 6px | Small element gaps |
| space-5 | 8px | Base unit -- button padding, input padding, badge padding |
| space-6 | 12px | Standard component gap, button horizontal padding |
| space-7 | 16px | Section internal padding, card spacing |
| space-8 | 24px | Large component padding, card internal spacing |
| space-9 | 32px | Section padding, container gutters |
| space-10 | 48px | Large section vertical spacing |
| space-11 | 64px | Major section breaks |
| space-12 | 96-120px | Hero vertical padding, maximum section spacing |

### Grid & Container
- Max content width: ~1440px (inferred from breakpoints)
- Page gutter: 32px on desktop, 16px on mobile
- Content sections use full-bleed backgrounds with centered, max-width content
- Multi-column layouts: 2-3 columns on desktop, single column on mobile
- Card grids: CSS Grid with consistent gaps (16-24px)

### Whitespace Philosophy
Sanity uses aggressive vertical spacing between sections (64-120px) to create breathing room on the dark canvas. Within sections, spacing is tighter (16-32px), creating dense information clusters separated by generous voids. This rhythm gives the page a "slides" quality -- each section feels like its own focused frame.

### Border Radius Scale

| Token | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| radius-xs | 3px | Inputs, textareas, subtle rounding |
| radius-sm | 4-5px | Secondary buttons, small cards, tags |
| radius-md | 6px | Standard cards, containers |
| radius-lg | 12px | Large cards, feature containers, forms |
| radius-pill | 99999px | Primary buttons, badges, nav pills |

## 6. Depth & Elevation

### Shadow System

| Level | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Level 0 (Flat) | none | Default state for most elements -- dark surfaces create depth through color alone |
| Level 1 (Subtle) | 0px 0px 0px 1px `#212121` | Border-like shadow for minimal containment without visible borders |
| Level 2 (Focus) | 0 0 0 2px `var(--color-blue-500)` | Focus ring for inputs and interactive elements |
| Level 3 (Overlay) | Backdrop blur + semi-transparent dark | Navigation overlay, modal backgrounds |

### Depth Philosophy
Sanity''s depth system is almost entirely **colorimetric** rather than shadow-based. Elevation is communicated through surface color shifts: `#0b0b0b` (ground) -> `#212121` (elevated) -> `#353535` (prominent) -> `#ffffff` (inverted/highest). This approach is native to dark interfaces where traditional drop shadows would be invisible. The few shadows that exist are ring-based (0px 0px 0px Npx) or blur-based (backdrop-filter) rather than offset shadows, maintaining the flat, precision-engineered aesthetic.

Border-based containment (1px solid `#212121` or `#353535`) serves as the primary spatial separator, with the border darkness calibrated to be visible but not dominant. The system avoids "floating card" aesthetics -- everything feels mounted to the surface rather than hovering above it.

## 7. Do''s and Don''ts

### Do
- Use the achromatic gray scale as the foundation -- maintain pure neutral discipline with no warm/cool tinting
- Apply Electric Blue (`#0052ef`) consistently as the universal hover/active state across all interactive elements
- Use extreme negative letter-spacing (-2px to -4.48px) on display headings 48px and above
- Keep primary CTAs as full-pill shapes (99999px radius) with the coral-red (`#f36458`)
- Use IBM Plex Mono uppercase for technical labels, tags, and system metadata
- Communicate depth through surface color (dark-to-light) rather than shadows
- Maintain generous vertical section spacing (64-120px) on the dark canvas
- Use `"cv01", "cv11", "cv12", "cv13", "ss07"` OpenType features for display typography

### Don''t
- Don''t introduce warm or cool color tints to the neutral scale -- Sanity''s grays are pure achromatic
- Don''t use drop shadows for elevation -- dark interfaces demand colorimetric depth
- Don''t apply border-radius between 13px and 99998px -- the system jumps from 12px (large card) directly to pill (99999px)
- Don''t mix the coral-red CTA with the electric blue interactive color in the same element
- Don''t use heavy font weights (700+) -- the system maxes out at 600 and only for 11px uppercase labels
- Don''t place light text on light surfaces or dark text on dark surfaces without checking the gray-on-gray contrast ratio
- Don''t use traditional offset box-shadows -- ring shadows (0 0 0 Npx) or border-based containment only
- Don''t break the tight line-height on headings -- 1.00-1.24 is the range, never go to 1.5+ for display text

## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints

| Name | Width | Behavior |
|------|-------|----------|
| Desktop XL | >= 1640px | Full layout, maximum content width |
| Desktop | >= 1440px | Standard desktop layout |
| Desktop Compact | >= 1200px | Slightly condensed desktop |
| Laptop | >= 1100px | Reduced column widths |
| Tablet Landscape | >= 960px | 2-column layouts begin collapsing |
| Tablet | >= 768px | Transition zone, some elements stack |
| Mobile Large | >= 720px | Near-tablet layout |
| Mobile | >= 480px | Single-column, stacked layout |
| Mobile Small | >= 376px | Minimum supported width |

### Collapsing Strategy
- **Navigation**: Horizontal links collapse to hamburger menu below 768px
- **Hero typography**: Scales from 112px -> 72px -> 48px -> 38px across breakpoints, maintaining tight letter-spacing ratios
- **Grid layouts**: 3-column -> 2-column at ~960px, single-column below 768px
- **Card grids**: Horizontal scrolling on mobile instead of wrapping (preserving card aspect ratios)
- **Section spacing**: Vertical padding reduces by ~40% on mobile (120px -> 64px -> 48px)
- **Button sizing**: CTA pills maintain padding but reduce font size; ghost buttons stay fixed
- **Code blocks**: Horizontal scroll with preserved monospace formatting

### Mobile-Specific Adjustments
- Full-bleed sections extend edge-to-edge with 16px internal gutters
- Touch targets: minimum 44px for all interactive elements
- Heading letter-spacing relaxes slightly at mobile sizes (less aggressive negative tracking)
- Image containers switch from fixed aspect ratios to full-width with auto height

### Example Prompts

**Landing page section:**
"Create a feature section with a near-black (#0b0b0b) background. Use a 48px heading in Inter with -1.68px letter-spacing, white text. Below it, 16px body text in #b9b9b9 with 1.50 line-height. Include a coral-red (#f36458) pill button with white text and a secondary dark (#0b0b0b) pill button with #b9b9b9 text. Both buttons hover to #0052ef blue."

**Card grid:**
"Build a 3-column card grid on a #0b0b0b background. Each card has a #212121 surface, 1px solid #353535 border, 6px border-radius, and 24px padding. Card titles are 24px white with -0.24px letter-spacing. Body text is 13px #b9b9b9. Add a 13px IBM Plex Mono uppercase tag in #797979 at the top of each card."

**Form section:**
"Design a contact form on a #0b0b0b background. Inputs have #0b0b0b background, 1px solid #212121 border, 3px border-radius, 8px 12px padding, and #b9b9b9 placeholder text. Focus state shows a 2px blue (#0052ef) ring. Submit button is a full-width coral-red (#f36458) pill. Include a 13px #797979 helper text below each field."

### Iteration Guide
1. **Start dark**: Begin with `#0b0b0b` background, `#ffffff` primary text, `#b9b9b9` secondary text
2. **Add structure**: Use `#212121` surfaces and `#353535` borders for containment -- no shadows
3. **Apply typography**: Inter (or Space Grotesk) with tight letter-spacing on headings, 1.50 line-height on body
4. **Color punctuation**: Add `#f36458` for CTAs and `#0052ef` for all hover/interactive states
5. **Refine spacing**: 8px base unit, 24-32px within sections, 64-120px between sections
6. **Technical details**: Add IBM Plex Mono uppercase labels for tags and metadata
7. **Polish**: Ensure all interactive elements hover to `#0052ef`, all buttons are pills or subtle 5px radius, borders are hairline (1px)

Sanity''s website is a developer-content platform rendered as a nocturnal command center -- dark, precise, and deeply structured. The entire experience sits on a near-black canvas (`#0b0b0b`) that reads less like a "dark mode toggle" and more like the natural state of a tool built for people who live in terminals. Where most CMS marketing pages reach for friendly pastels and soft illustration, Sanity leans into the gravity of its own product: structured content deserves a structured stage.

The signature typographic voice is waldenburgNormal -- a distinctive, slightly geometric sans-serif with tight negative letter-spacing (-0.32px to -4.48px at display sizes) that gives headlines a compressed, engineered quality. At 112px hero scale with -4.48px tracking, the type feels almost machined -- like precision-cut steel letterforms. This is paired with IBM Plex Mono for code and technical labels, creating a dual-register voice: editorial authority meets developer credibility.

What makes Sanity distinctive is the interplay between its monochromatic dark palette and vivid, saturated accent punctuation. The neutral scale runs from pure black through a tightly controlled gray ramp (`#0b0b0b` -> `#212121` -> `#353535` -> `#797979` -> `#b9b9b9` -> `#ededed` -> `#ffffff`) with no warm or cool bias -- just pure, achromatic precision. Against this disciplined backdrop, a neon green accent (display-p3 green) and electric blue (`#0052ef`) land with the impact of signal lights in a dark control room. The orange-red CTA (`#f36458`) provides the only warm touch in an otherwise cool system.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Near-black canvas (`#0b0b0b`) as the default, natural environment -- not a dark "mode" but the primary identity
- waldenburgNormal with extreme negative tracking at display sizes, creating a precision-engineered typographic voice
- Pure achromatic gray scale -- no warm or cool undertones, pure neutral discipline
- Vivid accent punctuation: neon green, electric blue (`#0052ef`), and coral-red (`#f36458`) against the dark field
- Pill-shaped primary buttons (99999px radius) contrasting with subtle rounded rectangles (3-6px) for secondary actions
- IBM Plex Mono as the technical counterweight to the editorial display face
- Full-bleed dark sections with content contained in measured max-width containers
- Hover states that shift to electric blue (`#0052ef`) across all interactive elements -- a consistent "activation" signal', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/sanity/DESIGN.md","category":"overview"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 2),
((select id from d), 'colors', '2. Color Palette & Roles', 'colors', '## 2. Color Palette & Roles

### Primary Brand
- **Sanity Black** (`#0b0b0b`): The primary canvas and dominant surface color. Not pure black but close enough to feel absolute. The foundation of the entire visual identity.
- **Pure Black** (`#000000`): Used for maximum-contrast moments, deep overlays, and certain border accents.
- **Sanity Red** (`#f36458`): The primary CTA and brand accent -- a warm coral-red that serves as the main call-to-action color. Used for "Get Started" buttons and primary conversion points.

### Accent & Interactive
- **Electric Blue** (`#0052ef`): The universal hover/active state color across the entire system. Buttons, links, and interactive elements all shift to this blue on hover. Also used as `--color-blue-700` for focus rings and active states.
- **Light Blue** (`#55beff` / `#afe3ff`): Secondary blue variants used for accent backgrounds, badges, and dimmed blue surfaces.
- **Neon Green** (`color(display-p3 .270588 1 0)`): A vivid, wide-gamut green used as `--color-fg-accent-green` for success states and premium feature highlights. Falls back to `#19d600` in sRGB.
- **Accent Magenta** (`color(display-p3 .960784 0 1)`): A vivid wide-gamut magenta for specialized accent moments.

### Surface & Background
- **Near Black** (`#0b0b0b`): Default page background and primary surface.
- **Dark Gray** (`#212121`): Elevated surface color for cards, secondary containers, input backgrounds, and subtle layering above the base canvas.
- **Medium Dark** (`#353535`): Tertiary surface and border color for creating depth between dark layers.
- **Pure White** (`#ffffff`): Used for inverted sections, light-on-dark text, and specific button surfaces.
- **Light Gray** (`#ededed`): Light surface for inverted/light sections and subtle background tints.

### Neutrals & Text
- **White** (`#ffffff`): Primary text color on dark surfaces, maximum legibility.
- **Silver** (`#b9b9b9`): Secondary text, body copy on dark surfaces, muted descriptions, and placeholder text.
- **Medium Gray** (`#797979`): Tertiary text, metadata, timestamps, and de-emphasized content.
- **Charcoal** (`#212121`): Text on light/inverted surfaces.
- **Near Black Text** (`#0b0b0b`): Primary text on white/light button surfaces.

### Semantic
- **Error Red** (`#dd0000`): Destructive actions, validation errors, and critical warnings -- a pure, high-saturation red.
- **GPC Green** (`#37cd84`): Privacy/compliance indicator green.
- **Focus Ring Blue** (`#0052ef`): Focus ring color for accessibility, matching the interactive blue.

### Border System
- **Dark Border** (`#0b0b0b`): Primary border on dark containers -- barely visible, maintaining minimal containment.
- **Subtle Border** (`#212121`): Standard border for inputs, textareas, and card edges on dark surfaces.
- **Medium Border** (`#353535`): More visible borders for emphasized containment and dividers.
- **Light Border** (`#ffffff`): Border on inverted/light elements or buttons needing contrast separation.
- **Orange Border** (`color(display-p3 1 0.3333 0)`): Special accent border for highlighted/featured elements.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/sanity/DESIGN.md","category":"colors"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 3),

### Principles
- **Extreme negative tracking at scale**: Display headings at 72px+ use aggressive negative letter-spacing (-2.88px to -4.48px), creating a tight, engineered quality that distinguishes Sanity from looser editorial typography.
- **Single font, multiple registers**: waldenburgNormal handles both editorial display and functional UI text. The weight range is narrow (400-425 for most, 500-600 only for tiny labels), keeping the voice consistent.
- **OpenType feature control**: Typography uses deliberate feature settings including `"cv01", "cv11", "cv12", "cv13", "ss07"` for display sizes and `"calt" 0` for body text, fine-tuning character alternates for different contexts.
- **Tight headings, relaxed body**: Headings use 1.00-1.24 line-height (extremely tight), while body text breathes at 1.50. This contrast creates clear visual hierarchy.
- **Uppercase for technical labels**: IBM Plex Mono captions and small labels frequently use `text-transform: uppercase` with tight line-heights, creating a "system readout" aesthetic for technical metadata.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/sanity/DESIGN.md","category":"typography"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 4),

### Spacing System
Base unit: **8px**

| Token | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| space-1 | 1px | Hairline gaps, border-like spacing |
| space-2 | 2px | Minimal internal padding |
| space-3 | 4px | Tight component internal spacing |
| space-4 | 6px | Small element gaps |
| space-5 | 8px | Base unit -- button padding, input padding, badge padding |
| space-6 | 12px | Standard component gap, button horizontal padding |
| space-7 | 16px | Section internal padding, card spacing |
| space-8 | 24px | Large component padding, card internal spacing |
| space-9 | 32px | Section padding, container gutters |
| space-10 | 48px | Large section vertical spacing |
| space-11 | 64px | Major section breaks |
| space-12 | 96-120px | Hero vertical padding, maximum section spacing |

### Grid & Container
- Max content width: ~1440px (inferred from breakpoints)
- Page gutter: 32px on desktop, 16px on mobile
- Content sections use full-bleed backgrounds with centered, max-width content
- Multi-column layouts: 2-3 columns on desktop, single column on mobile
- Card grids: CSS Grid with consistent gaps (16-24px)

### Whitespace Philosophy
Sanity uses aggressive vertical spacing between sections (64-120px) to create breathing room on the dark canvas. Within sections, spacing is tighter (16-32px), creating dense information clusters separated by generous voids. This rhythm gives the page a "slides" quality -- each section feels like its own focused frame.

### Border Radius Scale

| Token | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| radius-xs | 3px | Inputs, textareas, subtle rounding |
| radius-sm | 4-5px | Secondary buttons, small cards, tags |
| radius-md | 6px | Standard cards, containers |
| radius-lg | 12px | Large cards, feature containers, forms |

((select id from d), 'elevation', '6. Depth & Elevation', 'elevation', '## 6. Depth & Elevation

### Shadow System

| Level | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Level 0 (Flat) | none | Default state for most elements -- dark surfaces create depth through color alone |
| Level 1 (Subtle) | 0px 0px 0px 1px `#212121` | Border-like shadow for minimal containment without visible borders |
| Level 2 (Focus) | 0 0 0 2px `var(--color-blue-500)` | Focus ring for inputs and interactive elements |
| Level 3 (Overlay) | Backdrop blur + semi-transparent dark | Navigation overlay, modal backgrounds |

### Depth Philosophy
Sanity''s depth system is almost entirely **colorimetric** rather than shadow-based. Elevation is communicated through surface color shifts: `#0b0b0b` (ground) -> `#212121` (elevated) -> `#353535` (prominent) -> `#ffffff` (inverted/highest). This approach is native to dark interfaces where traditional drop shadows would be invisible. The few shadows that exist are ring-based (0px 0px 0px Npx) or blur-based (backdrop-filter) rather than offset shadows, maintaining the flat, precision-engineered aesthetic.

Border-based containment (1px solid `#212121` or `#353535`) serves as the primary spatial separator, with the border darkness calibrated to be visible but not dominant. The system avoids "floating card" aesthetics -- everything feels mounted to the surface rather than hovering above it.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/sanity/DESIGN.md","category":"elevation"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 7),
((select id from d), 'dos_and_donts', '7. Do''s and Don''ts', 'dos_and_donts', '## 7. Do''s and Don''ts

### Do
- Use the achromatic gray scale as the foundation -- maintain pure neutral discipline with no warm/cool tinting
- Apply Electric Blue (`#0052ef`) consistently as the universal hover/active state across all interactive elements
- Use extreme negative letter-spacing (-2px to -4.48px) on display headings 48px and above
- Keep primary CTAs as full-pill shapes (99999px radius) with the coral-red (`#f36458`)
- Use IBM Plex Mono uppercase for technical labels, tags, and system metadata
- Communicate depth through surface color (dark-to-light) rather than shadows
- Maintain generous vertical section spacing (64-120px) on the dark canvas
- Use `"cv01", "cv11", "cv12", "cv13", "ss07"` OpenType features for display typography

### Don''t
- Don''t introduce warm or cool color tints to the neutral scale -- Sanity''s grays are pure achromatic
- Don''t use drop shadows for elevation -- dark interfaces demand colorimetric depth
- Don''t apply border-radius between 13px and 99998px -- the system jumps from 12px (large card) directly to pill (99999px)
- Don''t mix the coral-red CTA with the electric blue interactive color in the same element
- Don''t use heavy font weights (700+) -- the system maxes out at 600 and only for 11px uppercase labels
- Don''t place light text on light surfaces or dark text on dark surfaces without checking the gray-on-gray contrast ratio
- Don''t use traditional offset box-shadows -- ring shadows (0 0 0 Npx) or border-based containment only
- Don''t break the tight line-height on headings -- 1.00-1.24 is the range, never go to 1.5+ for display text', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/sanity/DESIGN.md","category":"dos_and_donts"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 8),

### Breakpoints

| Name | Width | Behavior |
|------|-------|----------|
| Desktop XL | >= 1640px | Full layout, maximum content width |
| Desktop | >= 1440px | Standard desktop layout |
| Desktop Compact | >= 1200px | Slightly condensed desktop |
| Laptop | >= 1100px | Reduced column widths |
| Tablet Landscape | >= 960px | 2-column layouts begin collapsing |
| Tablet | >= 768px | Transition zone, some elements stack |
| Mobile Large | >= 720px | Near-tablet layout |
| Mobile | >= 480px | Single-column, stacked layout |
| Mobile Small | >= 376px | Minimum supported width |

### Collapsing Strategy
- **Navigation**: Horizontal links collapse to hamburger menu below 768px
- **Hero typography**: Scales from 112px -> 72px -> 48px -> 38px across breakpoints, maintaining tight letter-spacing ratios
- **Grid layouts**: 3-column -> 2-column at ~960px, single-column below 768px
- **Card grids**: Horizontal scrolling on mobile instead of wrapping (preserving card aspect ratios)
- **Section spacing**: Vertical padding reduces by ~40% on mobile (120px -> 64px -> 48px)
- **Button sizing**: CTA pills maintain padding but reduce font size; ghost buttons stay fixed
- **Code blocks**: Horizontal scroll with preserved monospace formatting

### Mobile-Specific Adjustments
- Full-bleed sections extend edge-to-edge with 16px internal gutters
- Touch targets: minimum 44px for all interactive elements
- Heading letter-spacing relaxes slightly at mobile sizes (less aggressive negative tracking)
- Image containers switch from fixed aspect ratios to full-width with auto height', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/sanity/DESIGN.md","category":"responsive_guidelines"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 9),

"Design a contact form on a #0b0b0b background. Inputs have #0b0b0b background, 1px solid #212121 border, 3px border-radius, 8px 12px padding, and #b9b9b9 placeholder text. Focus state shows a 2px blue (#0052ef) ring. Submit button is a full-width coral-red (#f36458) pill. Include a 13px #797979 helper text below each field."

**Navigation bar:**
"Create a sticky top navigation on #0b0b0b with backdrop blur. Left: brand text in 15px white. Center/right: nav links in 16px #b9b9b9 that hover to blue. Far right: a coral-red (#f36458) pill CTA button. Bottom border: 1px solid #212121."

### Iteration Guide
1. **Start dark**: Begin with `#0b0b0b` background, `#ffffff` primary text, `#b9b9b9` secondary text
2. **Add structure**: Use `#212121` surfaces and `#353535` borders for containment -- no shadows
3. **Apply typography**: Inter (or Space Grotesk) with tight letter-spacing on headings, 1.50 line-height on body
4. **Color punctuation**: Add `#f36458` for CTAs and `#0052ef` for all hover/interactive states
5. **Refine spacing**: 8px base unit, 24-32px within sections, 64-120px between sections
6. **Technical details**: Add IBM Plex Mono uppercase labels for tags and metadata
7. **Polish**: Ensure all interactive elements hover to `#0052ef`, all buttons are pills or subtle 5px radius, borders are hairline (1px)', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/sanity/DESIGN.md","category":"other"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 10);

description: An inspired interpretation of Sentri''s design language — a developer-tools brand built on a deep purple-violet midnight canvas, electric lime accents, and a slightly subversive illustrated personality. The system pairs a custom display sans (chunky, playful, near-condensed) with the open Rubik family for UI copy and Monaco for code, then leans on dark-on-light pricing surfaces, sticker-style mascots, and a single-color CTA hierarchy where black-violet buttons read as the primary action against either polarity.

## Overview

Sentri''s design language reads like a debugging console wearing a leather jacket. The home and product surfaces sit on a near-black violet midnight (`{colors.surface-canvas-dark}` / `{colors.surface-night}`), strewn with starfield textures and floating sticker-style mascots — astronauts, monsters, traffic cones — that puncture the seriousness of an observability product. Headlines run in a chunky proprietary display sans where the most important keywords are wrapped in lime-green highlight chips (`{colors.accent-lime}`), as if the copy itself has been marked up by a developer redlining their own console output.

The palette is deliberately narrow: deep midnight as the dominant canvas, electric lime as the primary attention-grabber, hot pink (`{colors.accent-pink}`) as a secondary punctuation, and a violet-mid (`{colors.accent-violet-mid}`) for tag chips and hairline strokes. White appears in two roles — as text on dark, and as the canvas for pricing, contact, and content-heavy pages where developers need to scan dense tables. The "single primary CTA" is visually inverted depending on context: filled black-violet (`{colors.primary}`) with white type on light surfaces, or filled white with dark type on dark surfaces. The button always reads as the strongest UI affordance regardless of polarity.

Typography splits cleanly between three families: a custom display sans for hero and section openers (chunky, near-condensed, slightly playful), Rubik for every UI text role (body, captions, eyebrow caps, button labels), and Monaco for code. Buttons and eyebrows almost always run in uppercase with a 0.2px tracking lift to give them the snap of console output.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Two-polarity canvas system: deep violet midnight (`{colors.surface-canvas-dark}`) for marketing hero and product feature pages, white (`{colors.surface-canvas-light}`) for pricing, contact, and dense reference content — the system never tries to blur the two.
- Lime keyword highlight (`{colors.accent-lime}`) treated as a typographic device, not a color swatch — it wraps single words inside the display headline to act as a syntax highlight on the reading flow.
- Sticker illustration system: floating mascot characters with hand-drawn outlines, appearing at section junctions, never inside cards — they create rhythm and personality between dense info blocks.
- Uppercase eyebrow + button caps in `{typography.button-cap}` and `{typography.eyebrow}`, with a consistent 0.2px tracking lift, give the brand its "developer console" cadence.
- Single-primary CTA hierarchy: every page has one filled button reading either `{colors.primary}` on light or `{colors.on-primary}` on dark; outlined and ghost variants are downgraded.
- Card surfaces follow the canvas: dark sections nest dark cards (`{colors.ink-deep}` with subtle hairline) and light sections nest white cards with `{colors.hairline-cloud}` borders — chrome stays consistent, only the polarity flips.
- A pricing-page color rhythm of cream-white tiers with one dark inverted "featured" tier (`{colors.surface-night}`), avoiding the typical accent-bordered featured pattern.

## Colors

> **Source pages:** home (`/welcome/`), product/error-monitoring, contact/enterprise, pricing.

### Brand & Accent
- **Midnight Violet** (`{colors.primary}` — `#150f23`): The system''s primary action color and the deepest surface tone. Used for filled primary buttons on light surfaces, code-block backgrounds, and the strongest dark cards.
- **Ink Violet** (`{colors.ink-deep}` — `#1f1633`): Slightly lifted from primary, this is the marketing hero canvas and the default body-text color on light surfaces — a single token doing double duty as background and ink.
- **Electric Lime** (`{colors.accent-lime}` — `#c2ef4e`): The signature highlight color. Wrapped around individual headline keywords as a syntax-highlight chip (`{rounded.xs}` corner, no padding-y, 12px padding-x). Also used as the squiggly footer divider stroke. Never a button background.
- **Hot Pink** (`{colors.accent-pink}` — `#fa7faa`): Secondary punctuation color used for sticker outlines, chart points, and supporting accents — never on buttons, never on type at body size.
- **Violet Link** (`{colors.accent-violet}` — `#6a5fc1`): Inline link color when emphasis is needed beyond underline.
- **Deep Violet** (`{colors.accent-violet-deep}` — `#422082`): The select-dropdown fill on contact forms; also used on spotlight cards inside dark sections.
- **Mid Violet** (`{colors.accent-violet-mid}` — `#79628c`): Tag-chip fill and faint accent on dark surfaces.

### Surface
- **Dark Canvas** (`{colors.surface-canvas-dark}` — `#1f1633`): Hero, product, and feature-page background. Carries the deepest atmospheric weight.
- **Night** (`{colors.surface-night}` — `#150f23`): Cards on dark canvas, code blocks, and the "featured" pricing tier.
- **Light Canvas** (`{colors.surface-canvas-light}` — `#ffffff`): Pricing, contact, and dense-reference page background.
- **Surface Press Light** (`{colors.surface-press-light}` — `#f0f0f0`) and **Press Stronger** (`{colors.surface-press-stronger}` — `#efefef`): The pressed/active fill of inverted buttons on dark surfaces.
- **Hairline Violet** (`{colors.hairline-violet}` — `#362d59`): 1px borders on dark cards.
- **Hairline Cool** (`{colors.hairline-cool}` — `#cfcfdb`): 1px borders on text inputs and form fields.
- **Hairline Cloud** (`{colors.hairline-cloud}` — `#e5e7eb`): Pricing-table dividers and pricing-card borders on light canvas.

### Text
- **On Primary** (`{colors.on-primary}` — `#ffffff`): All text on dark canvas, all CTA labels on filled dark buttons.
- **Ink** (`{colors.ink}` — `#1f1633`): Body text on light canvas; identical hex to the dark canvas, repurposed as type.
- **Ink Press** (`{colors.ink-press}` — `#1a1a1a`): Reserved for the pressed/active state of inverted buttons.
- **On Dark Muted** (`{colors.on-dark-muted}` — `rgba(255,255,255,0.72)`): Secondary text, captions, and table cell values on dark canvas.
- **On Dark Faint** (`{colors.on-dark-faint}` — `rgba(255,255,255,0.18)`): Translucent surface-on-dark — used for ghost button fills and dimmed nav items.

### Semantic
- **Focus Ring** (`{colors.ring-focus}` — `rgba(59,130,246,0.5)`): Translucent blue focus ring — the only blue in the system, reserved for keyboard focus on form fields.

## Typography

### Font Family

The display tier is a proprietary geometric sans with chunky, near-condensed proportions and a slightly subversive personality (closing apertures, optical-stress letterforms). When unavailable, fall back to **Rubik** at heavier weights for visual continuity.

The UI tier is **Rubik** — an open-source Hebrew/Latin sans on Google Fonts — with system fallbacks (`-apple-system, system-ui, Segoe UI, Helvetica, Arial`). Rubik handles every body, caption, button, and eyebrow role.

The code tier is **Monaco** with Menlo and Ubuntu Mono fallbacks — used in code blocks, install snippets, and inline tokens.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-hero}` | 88px | 700 | 1.2 | 0 | Marketing hero headline (single line of attention) |
| `{typography.display-large}` | 60px | 500 | 1.1 | 0 | Section openers on dark surfaces |
| `{typography.heading-xl}` | 30px | 500 | 1.2 | 0 | Page titles on light surfaces (e.g., "Pricing plans for dev teams of all sizes") |
| `{typography.heading-lg}` | 27px | 500 | 1.25 | 0 | Sub-section headings, large card titles |
| `{typography.heading-md}` | 24px | 500 | 1.25 | 0 | Card titles, in-page section headings |
| `{typography.heading-sm}` | 20px | 600 | 1.25 | 0 | Compact card title, list-group title |
| `{typography.body-lg}` | 16px | 400 | 2.0 | 0 | Marketing-paragraph body — the airy, two-line-leading variant used in hero subtext |
| `{typography.body-strong}` | 16px | 600 | 1.5 | 0 | Emphasized body run, lead sentence |
| `{typography.body-md}` | 16px | 500 | 1.5 | 0 | Default UI body, table cells, form labels |
| `{typography.eyebrow}` | 15px | 500 | 1.4 | 0 | Section eyebrow above large headings, all-caps |
| `{typography.button-cap}` | 14px | 700 | 1.14 | 0.2px | Filled button labels (uppercase) |
| `{typography.button-cap-light}` | 14px | 500 | 1.29 | 0.2px | Ghost / outline button labels (uppercase) |
| `{typography.caption}` | 14px | 400 | 1.43 | 0 | Footer text, fine print, helper copy |
| `{typography.micro-cap}` | 10px | 600 | 1.8 | 0.25px | Status labels, badge text, micro-eyebrow |
| `{typography.code}` | 16px | 400 | 1.5 | 0 | Code block content |
| `{typography.code-strong}` | 16px | 700 | 1.5 | 0 | Highlighted code keyword |

### Principles
- **Two leading worlds.** Marketing copy uses 2.0 line-height on `{typography.body-lg}` — extremely airy, generous breathing room. Functional UI copy uses 1.5 line-height on `{typography.body-md}` — denser, closer to console output. The choice is deliberate: marketing reads like prose, the product reads like a log.
- **Caps with tracking.** All button labels and eyebrows are uppercase with 0.2px tracking. This is the brand''s typographic signature — a console-prompt cadence applied to UI affordances.
- **Headlines as syntax.** The hero display is structured so a single keyword can be wrapped in a `{colors.accent-lime}` highlight chip without disrupting the reading order. Treat the lime chip as a glyph-level decoration, not a separate component.

### Note on Font Substitutes
Rubik is open-source on Google Fonts and is the safe default for everything except the hero display. For the proprietary display sans, suitable open substitutes are **Space Grotesk** (heavier weights), **Archivo** (semi-condensed weights), or **Hubot Sans** with optical-size axis at heavier ends — all carry the same chunky, near-condensed silhouette. Adjust line-height down by 0.05 when substituting, since the proprietary face has tighter leading at large sizes.

## Layout

### Spacing System
- **Base unit**: 8px
- **Tokens**: `{spacing.xxs}` 2px · `{spacing.xs}` 4px · `{spacing.sm}` 8px · `{spacing.md}` 12px · `{spacing.lg}` 16px · `{spacing.xl}` 24px · `{spacing.xxl}` 32px · `{spacing.section}` 96px
- **Section padding**: `{spacing.section}` 96px between major page bands on desktop, collapsing to `{spacing.xxl}` 32px–48px on mobile.
- **Card internal padding**: `{spacing.xxl}` 32px on pricing cards and large feature cards; `{spacing.lg}` 16px on compact tag/badge groups.
- **Form field padding**: `{spacing.sm}` 8px vertical, `{spacing.md}` 12px horizontal — matches the text-input token directly.

### Grid & Container
- Marketing pages use a wide centered container with generous outer gutters; max width sits around 1152px (one of the extracted breakpoints), with content inside flexing across 12 conceptual columns.
- Pricing splits into a 4-tier card row at desktop, collapsing to 2-up at mid widths and 1-up on mobile.
- The contact form uses a 2-column field layout (first/last name side-by-side) inside a single light-canvas panel.
- Breakpoints stair-step at 1440 → 1152 → 992 → 768 → 640 → 576 — see Responsive Behavior.

### Whitespace Philosophy
The dark canvas absorbs whitespace differently from light. On dark surfaces the brand stretches `{spacing.section}` generously between bands so floating mascots and starfield textures have room to breathe. On light surfaces (pricing, contact) the whitespace tightens — content density takes priority because users are scanning, comparing, and acting. Rule of thumb: hero and feature surfaces are spacious, transactional surfaces are dense.

## Elevation & Depth

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Flat on canvas, no shadow | Default surface, dark or light |
| 1 | `box-shadow: rgba(0,0,0,0.08) 0 2px 8px 0` | Inverted buttons on dark canvas (light fill lifting off dark surface) |
| 2 | `box-shadow: rgba(0,0,0,0.1) 0 10px 15px -3px, rgba(0,0,0,0.1) 0 4px 6px -4px` | Floating cards on light canvas, modals |
| 3 | `box-shadow: rgb(21,15,35) 0 0 8px 6px` | Glow halo around primary CTA on dark hero — the dark color itself becomes the shadow, creating a vignette of canvas around the button |
| 4 | `box-shadow: rgba(0,0,0,0.18) 0 0.5rem 1.5rem` | Pressed inverted button on dark canvas |

### Decorative Depth
Sentri''s depth doesn''t come from drop shadows — it comes from the **starfield texture** on the hero canvas (subtle white-on-violet pinpricks at low opacity), the **floating sticker mascots** (drawn with hand-rendered outlines and saturated fills, layered above the canvas with no shadow), and the **lime squiggly divider** above the footer. These illustrative elements do the work that shadow stacks do in flatter design systems — they tell the eye where one section ends and another begins.

## Shapes

### Border Radius Scale

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{rounded.xs}` | 4px | Badges, status pills, lime keyword highlight chips |
| `{rounded.sm}` | 6px | Text inputs, search boxes |
| `{rounded.md}` | 8px | Primary and inverted buttons, code blocks, select dropdowns |
| `{rounded.lg}` | 10px | Generic divs, container blocks |
| `{rounded.xl}` | 12px | Pricing cards, feature cards, navigation pill chrome |
| `{rounded.xxl}` | 18px | Image containers, large hero illustrations |
| `{rounded.full}` | 9999px | Avatars, circular icon buttons |

### Photography Geometry
The site doesn''t use traditional photography — it uses **illustrated stickers and product UI screenshots** in roughly equivalent geometric roles. Product UI mocks sit inside `{rounded.xxl}` 18px containers, often tilted slightly off-axis, against the dark canvas with no border. Sticker mascots have no container at all — they are layered directly on canvas, often overlapping section boundaries to break the grid. Avatar treatments (in customer-logo strips) are simple greyscale wordmarks, not photos.

## Components

> **No hover states documented.** Every spec below shows only Default and Pressed/Active states. Variants are formal entries in the front-matter `components:` block.

### Buttons

**`button-primary`** — the dominant CTA across light surfaces.
- Background `{colors.primary}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.button-cap}` (uppercase, 14px / 700, 0.2px tracking), padding `{spacing.md} {spacing.lg}` (12px 16px), rounded `{rounded.md}`. On dark hero surfaces, add the level-3 glow halo for emphasis.
- Pressed state lives in `button-primary-pressed`: background flips to `{colors.surface-press-stronger}`, text to `{colors.ink-press}`. The button effectively swaps polarities on press.

**`button-inverted`** — the dominant CTA on dark canvas; visually identical hierarchy, polarity-flipped.
- Background `{colors.on-primary}` (white), text `{colors.ink-deep}`, same `{typography.button-cap}`, rounded `{rounded.md}`.
- Pressed in `button-inverted-pressed`: background drops to `{colors.surface-press-light}`, text to `{colors.ink-press}`.

**`button-ghost-on-dark`** — secondary CTA on dark canvas (e.g., "Get Demo" beside "Get Started").
- Translucent fill `{colors.on-dark-faint}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.button-cap}`, padding `{spacing.sm}` (8px), rounded `{rounded.xl}`. The translucent fill lets the canvas texture show through.

**`button-violet-token`** — pill-shaped tag/category button used inline in product navs.
- Background `{colors.accent-violet-mid}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.button-cap-light}`, padding `{spacing.sm} {spacing.lg}` (8px 16px), rounded `{rounded.xl}`, 1px hairline border in a slightly deeper violet.

**`button-disabled`**
- Background `{colors.hairline-cloud}`, text `{colors.on-dark-muted}`, otherwise identical to `button-primary`.

### Cards & Containers

**`card-pricing`** — the standard tier card on the pricing page.
- Background `{colors.surface-canvas-light}`, text `{colors.ink-deep}`, padding `{spacing.xxl}` 32px, rounded `{rounded.xl}` 12px, 1px `{colors.hairline-cloud}` border. Headline at top in `{typography.heading-md}`, price in `{typography.display-large}`, feature list in `{typography.body-md}`, primary CTA pinned to the bottom of the card.

**`card-pricing-featured`** — the dark inverted "featured" tier (Sentri uses the Business tier as the featured one).
- Background `{colors.surface-night}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, otherwise identical structure to `card-pricing`. The inversion (rather than an accent-bordered light card) is the brand''s distinctive choice — the featured tier reads as the brand''s voice, not as a marketing decoration.

**`card-feature-dark`** — large feature-band card on dark surfaces, used to anchor product feature explanations.
- Background `{colors.ink-deep}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, padding `{spacing.xxl}` 32px, rounded `{rounded.xxl}` 18px. Often holds a UI mock plus a 27px headline plus 16px body.

**`card-spotlight-violet`** — accent feature card with deeper violet fill, used for "Sentry-only" capability bands.
- Background `{colors.accent-violet-deep}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, padding `{spacing.xxl}`, rounded `{rounded.xxl}`. The deep violet reads as a feature highlight without breaking out of the brand''s purple family.

**`code-block`** — code/install snippets.
- Background `{colors.surface-night}`, text `{colors.on-primary}` rendered in `{typography.code}`. Padding `{spacing.lg}` 16px, rounded `{rounded.md}`. On dark canvas the code block is barely lifted from canvas — only the slightly deeper fill differentiates it.

### Inputs & Forms

**`text-input`** — the contact-form first/last/email/etc. fields.
- Background `{colors.surface-canvas-light}`, text `{colors.ink-deep}`, type `{typography.body-md}`, padding `{spacing.sm} {spacing.md}` (8px 12px), rounded `{rounded.sm}` 6px, 1px `{colors.hairline-cool}` border.
- Focus state in `text-input-focused`: same fill, but adds an inset shadow `rgba(0,0,0,0.15) 0 2px 10px inset` to suggest depth pressed inward.

**`select-violet`** — the dropdown variant used inside dark contact panels.
- Background `{colors.accent-violet-deep}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.body-md}`, padding `{spacing.sm} {spacing.lg}`, rounded `{rounded.md}`. Distinctive because it doesn''t mimic a plain text input — it reads as a deliberate brand surface.

### Navigation

**`nav-bar-light`** — the standard top nav across light pages (pricing, contact, docs).
- Background `{colors.surface-canvas-light}`, text `{colors.ink-deep}`, type `{typography.body-md}`. Logo wordmark on the left at ~145×32px, primary nav items mid-bar with dropdown carets, and a `Get Demo` ghost + `Get Started` filled `button-primary` pair on the right. Padding `{spacing.lg} {spacing.xl}` (16px 24px).

**Top Nav (dark variant)** — used on the home page; same structure but inverted polarity, sitting on `{colors.surface-canvas-dark}`. The right-side button becomes `button-inverted`.

**Mobile nav** — collapses to a hamburger toggle below the 768px breakpoint; dropdown carets become full-width accordion items.

### Pills, Badges, and Highlight Chips

**`pill-neutral-dark`** — small status / category pill on dark surfaces.
- Background `{colors.surface-night}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.caption}` 12px, padding `{spacing.xs} {spacing.sm}` (4px 8px), rounded `{rounded.xs}` 4px.

**`chip-lime-keyword`** — the signature inline highlight wrapping single words inside the hero display headline.
- Background `{colors.accent-lime}`, text `{colors.ink-deep}`, type matches the surrounding `{typography.display-hero}`, rounded `{rounded.xs}` 4px, padding `0 {spacing.md}` (12px horizontal, 0 vertical so the chip hugs the cap-height).

### Signature Components

**Sticker Mascot Layer** — illustrated characters (astronauts, cartoon monsters, traffic cones, debugging avatars) drawn with hand-rendered outlines and saturated `{colors.accent-pink}` / `{colors.accent-lime}` fills. Mascots are placed at section junctions, often overlapping section boundaries by 30–40% of their height, with no container or shadow. They function as decorative section markers and brand personality carriers — never inside cards, never as buttons.

**Lime Squiggly Footer Divider** — a hand-drawn `{colors.accent-lime}` squiggle line, ~3px stroke, sitting above the footer at full container width. Replaces what would otherwise be a 1px hairline divider with a personality-laden flourish.

**Starfield Hero Texture** — a faint white-on-violet pinprick pattern overlaid on the hero canvas at very low opacity. Adds atmospheric depth to the dark canvas without visible decoration. Implemented as a background image, not as repeating CSS.

**Window-Chrome UI Mock** — product UI screenshots framed in `{rounded.xxl}` containers, often tilted ±2–3 degrees off axis, positioned overlapping section boundaries on the dark feature pages. The chrome itself is just a rounded image with a subtle hairline; the content is the actual product UI.

**`link-on-dark`** — inline links in body copy on dark surfaces. Default text is `{colors.on-primary}` rendered in `{typography.body-md}` with a persistent underline; the underline is the entire affordance, no color change. Sits flush in copy with no padding, no rounded corners beyond the inherited `{rounded.xs}`.

**`link-on-light`** — inline links in body copy on light surfaces. Same shape contract as `link-on-dark`, but text is `{colors.ink-deep}`. Used across pricing, contact, and docs surfaces.

**`footer-light`** — site-wide footer on the light-canvas template (pricing, contact, docs).
- Background `{colors.surface-canvas-light}`, text `{colors.ink-deep}`, type `{typography.caption}`, padding `{spacing.xxl} {spacing.xl}` (32px 24px). Topped by the lime squiggly divider — see Signature Components. Holds three to four columns of link groups, social icons in a horizontal strip at the bottom right, and a small legal/copyright row at the very bottom in `{typography.caption}`.

## Do''s and Don''ts

### Do
- Reserve `{colors.accent-lime}` for keyword-highlight chips inside display headlines and the footer squiggle divider — never use it as a button background, never as body text.
- Pair every `button-primary` with `{typography.button-cap}` in uppercase with 0.2px tracking — the cadence is part of the brand, not a stylistic option.
- Treat the dark canvas (`{colors.surface-canvas-dark}`) and light canvas (`{colors.surface-canvas-light}`) as two complete worlds — let one own marketing/feature pages and the other own transactional pages, with no half-measures.
- Use sticker mascots to break section boundaries — let them overlap, tilt, and float; constraining them inside cards drains their personality.
- Use `card-pricing-featured` (dark inverted tier) instead of an accent-bordered light tier for the featured pricing column.
- Default body line-height to 1.5 on functional UI surfaces and 2.0 on marketing surfaces — the difference is intentional.

### Don''t
- Don''t introduce additional accent colors beyond `{colors.accent-lime}` and `{colors.accent-pink}` — adding teal, orange, or yellow dilutes the violet-and-lime signature.
- Don''t apply drop shadows to cards on dark canvas — depth comes from texture and illustration, not from light-on-dark shadows that would muddy the violet.
- Don''t use `{typography.display-hero}` (88px) for anything except the marketing hero — even sub-pages cap at `{typography.display-large}` (60px).
- Don''t put body text in `{colors.accent-lime}` — it''s a chip color, not a type color, and breaks contrast at body sizes.
- Don''t soften the `{colors.primary}` button to a brand-violet — the near-black is the point; it reads as the most authoritative action regardless of canvas polarity.
- Don''t put illustrated mascots inside cards or constrained containers — their job is to break grid, not occupy it.

## Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| 4K / Wide | ≥ 1440px | Full 4-tier pricing row, hero illustration sits beside headline at full scale |
| Desktop | 1152–1440px | Default content max-width sits at 1152px, all 4-tier patterns hold |
| Laptop | 992–1151px | Pricing collapses to 2-up rows, nav remains horizontal |
| Tablet | 768–991px | 2-column feature grids collapse to 1-up; nav still horizontal but compresses |
| Mobile Large | 640–767px | Hamburger nav appears; hero display drops from 88px to ~56px |
| Mobile | 576–639px | Single-column everything; section padding collapses from 96px to 32–48px |
| Small Mobile | 1–575px | Compact mode; sticker mascots drop in size or hide entirely to preserve content priority |

### Touch Targets
- Primary buttons hit a minimum 44×44px on mobile (12px vertical padding × 16px font + line-height = ~44px). Maintains WCAG AAA touch-target spec.
- Pill tags and badges in nav and feature surfaces stay above 32×32px even at small mobile breakpoints; they enlarge if necessary rather than shrink.
- Form fields stay at the 44px minimum height on mobile contact pages.

### Collapsing Strategy
- **Hero display headline** drops from 88px → 60px → 48px across the breakpoint stair; the lime keyword chip preserves padding and corner radius at every step.
- **Pricing tiers** stair-step from 4-up → 2-up → 1-up. The featured dark tier always remains visually distinguished — it never loses its inversion at any breakpoint.
- **Sticker mascots** are progressively de-emphasized: at desktop they overlap section boundaries; at tablet they shift to inline within section padding; at small mobile most are hidden via `display: none` to keep the content scan-able.
- **Top nav** collapses to a hamburger below 768px; the dropdown menu uses the same canvas polarity as the page (dark on hero, light on pricing).
- **Code blocks** preserve 16px Monaco at every breakpoint — they never scale down — but switch to horizontal scroll on overflow rather than wrap.

### Image Behavior
- Product UI mocks scale proportionally; on small mobile they often anchor to one edge with horizontal overflow rather than shrink to illegibility.
- Sticker mascots scale by 50–70% at mobile breakpoints, preserving their personality but ceding screen space to content.
- The lime footer squiggle scales the SVG to container width while keeping stroke width visually consistent.

## Iteration Guide

1. Focus on ONE component at a time. Don''t rebuild the system — extend it.
2. Reference component names and tokens directly (`{colors.accent-lime}`, `{button-primary}-pressed`, `{rounded.xxl}`) — do not paraphrase.
3. Run `npx @google/design.md lint DESIGN.md` after edits — `broken-ref`, `contrast-ratio`, and `orphaned-tokens` warnings flag issues automatically.
4. Add new variants as separate component entries (`-pressed`, `-disabled`, `-focused`) — do not bury them inside prose.
5. Default to `{typography.body-md}` for product UI body and `{typography.body-lg}` for marketing prose — the leading difference is intentional and load-bearing.
6. Keep `{colors.accent-lime}` scarce — one lime element per viewport. The signature only works because it''s rare.
7. When polarizing a new surface, choose one canvas (`{colors.surface-canvas-dark}` or `{colors.surface-canvas-light}`) and commit to it; don''t blend the two on a single page band.

Sentri''s design language reads like a debugging console wearing a leather jacket. The home and product surfaces sit on a near-black violet midnight (`{colors.surface-canvas-dark}` / `{colors.surface-night}`), strewn with starfield textures and floating sticker-style mascots — astronauts, monsters, traffic cones — that puncture the seriousness of an observability product. Headlines run in a chunky proprietary display sans where the most important keywords are wrapped in lime-green highlight chips (`{colors.accent-lime}`), as if the copy itself has been marked up by a developer redlining their own console output.

The palette is deliberately narrow: deep midnight as the dominant canvas, electric lime as the primary attention-grabber, hot pink (`{colors.accent-pink}`) as a secondary punctuation, and a violet-mid (`{colors.accent-violet-mid}`) for tag chips and hairline strokes. White appears in two roles — as text on dark, and as the canvas for pricing, contact, and content-heavy pages where developers need to scan dense tables. The "single primary CTA" is visually inverted depending on context: filled black-violet (`{colors.primary}`) with white type on light surfaces, or filled white with dark type on dark surfaces. The button always reads as the strongest UI affordance regardless of polarity.

Typography splits cleanly between three families: a custom display sans for hero and section openers (chunky, near-condensed, slightly playful), Rubik for every UI text role (body, captions, eyebrow caps, button labels), and Monaco for code. Buttons and eyebrows almost always run in uppercase with a 0.2px tracking lift to give them the snap of console output.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Two-polarity canvas system: deep violet midnight (`{colors.surface-canvas-dark}`) for marketing hero and product feature pages, white (`{colors.surface-canvas-light}`) for pricing, contact, and dense reference content — the system never tries to blur the two.
- Lime keyword highlight (`{colors.accent-lime}`) treated as a typographic device, not a color swatch — it wraps single words inside the display headline to act as a syntax highlight on the reading flow.
- Sticker illustration system: floating mascot characters with hand-drawn outlines, appearing at section junctions, never inside cards — they create rhythm and personality between dense info blocks.
- Uppercase eyebrow + button caps in `{typography.button-cap}` and `{typography.eyebrow}`, with a consistent 0.2px tracking lift, give the brand its "developer console" cadence.
- Single-primary CTA hierarchy: every page has one filled button reading either `{colors.primary}` on light or `{colors.on-primary}` on dark; outlined and ghost variants are downgraded.
- Card surfaces follow the canvas: dark sections nest dark cards (`{colors.ink-deep}` with subtle hairline) and light sections nest white cards with `{colors.hairline-cloud}` borders — chrome stays consistent, only the polarity flips.
- A pricing-page color rhythm of cream-white tiers with one dark inverted "featured" tier (`{colors.surface-night}`), avoiding the typical accent-bordered featured pattern.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/sentry/DESIGN.md","category":"overview"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 1),

### Brand & Accent
- **Midnight Violet** (`{colors.primary}` — `#150f23`): The system''s primary action color and the deepest surface tone. Used for filled primary buttons on light surfaces, code-block backgrounds, and the strongest dark cards.
- **Ink Violet** (`{colors.ink-deep}` — `#1f1633`): Slightly lifted from primary, this is the marketing hero canvas and the default body-text color on light surfaces — a single token doing double duty as background and ink.
- **Electric Lime** (`{colors.accent-lime}` — `#c2ef4e`): The signature highlight color. Wrapped around individual headline keywords as a syntax-highlight chip (`{rounded.xs}` corner, no padding-y, 12px padding-x). Also used as the squiggly footer divider stroke. Never a button background.
- **Hot Pink** (`{colors.accent-pink}` — `#fa7faa`): Secondary punctuation color used for sticker outlines, chart points, and supporting accents — never on buttons, never on type at body size.
- **Violet Link** (`{colors.accent-violet}` — `#6a5fc1`): Inline link color when emphasis is needed beyond underline.
- **Deep Violet** (`{colors.accent-violet-deep}` — `#422082`): The select-dropdown fill on contact forms; also used on spotlight cards inside dark sections.
- **Mid Violet** (`{colors.accent-violet-mid}` — `#79628c`): Tag-chip fill and faint accent on dark surfaces.

### Surface
- **Dark Canvas** (`{colors.surface-canvas-dark}` — `#1f1633`): Hero, product, and feature-page background. Carries the deepest atmospheric weight.
- **Night** (`{colors.surface-night}` — `#150f23`): Cards on dark canvas, code blocks, and the "featured" pricing tier.
- **Light Canvas** (`{colors.surface-canvas-light}` — `#ffffff`): Pricing, contact, and dense-reference page background.
- **Surface Press Light** (`{colors.surface-press-light}` — `#f0f0f0`) and **Press Stronger** (`{colors.surface-press-stronger}` — `#efefef`): The pressed/active fill of inverted buttons on dark surfaces.
- **Hairline Violet** (`{colors.hairline-violet}` — `#362d59`): 1px borders on dark cards.
- **Hairline Cool** (`{colors.hairline-cool}` — `#cfcfdb`): 1px borders on text inputs and form fields.
- **Hairline Cloud** (`{colors.hairline-cloud}` — `#e5e7eb`): Pricing-table dividers and pricing-card borders on light canvas.

### Text
- **On Primary** (`{colors.on-primary}` — `#ffffff`): All text on dark canvas, all CTA labels on filled dark buttons.
- **Ink** (`{colors.ink}` — `#1f1633`): Body text on light canvas; identical hex to the dark canvas, repurposed as type.
- **Ink Press** (`{colors.ink-press}` — `#1a1a1a`): Reserved for the pressed/active state of inverted buttons.
- **On Dark Muted** (`{colors.on-dark-muted}` — `rgba(255,255,255,0.72)`): Secondary text, captions, and table cell values on dark canvas.
- **On Dark Faint** (`{colors.on-dark-faint}` — `rgba(255,255,255,0.18)`): Translucent surface-on-dark — used for ghost button fills and dimmed nav items.

### Semantic
- **Focus Ring** (`{colors.ring-focus}` — `rgba(59,130,246,0.5)`): Translucent blue focus ring — the only blue in the system, reserved for keyboard focus on form fields.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/sentry/DESIGN.md","category":"colors"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 2),

### Font Family

The display tier is a proprietary geometric sans with chunky, near-condensed proportions and a slightly subversive personality (closing apertures, optical-stress letterforms). When unavailable, fall back to **Rubik** at heavier weights for visual continuity.

The UI tier is **Rubik** — an open-source Hebrew/Latin sans on Google Fonts — with system fallbacks (`-apple-system, system-ui, Segoe UI, Helvetica, Arial`). Rubik handles every body, caption, button, and eyebrow role.

The code tier is **Monaco** with Menlo and Ubuntu Mono fallbacks — used in code blocks, install snippets, and inline tokens.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-hero}` | 88px | 700 | 1.2 | 0 | Marketing hero headline (single line of attention) |
| `{typography.display-large}` | 60px | 500 | 1.1 | 0 | Section openers on dark surfaces |
| `{typography.heading-xl}` | 30px | 500 | 1.2 | 0 | Page titles on light surfaces (e.g., "Pricing plans for dev teams of all sizes") |
| `{typography.heading-lg}` | 27px | 500 | 1.25 | 0 | Sub-section headings, large card titles |
| `{typography.heading-md}` | 24px | 500 | 1.25 | 0 | Card titles, in-page section headings |
| `{typography.heading-sm}` | 20px | 600 | 1.25 | 0 | Compact card title, list-group title |
| `{typography.body-lg}` | 16px | 400 | 2.0 | 0 | Marketing-paragraph body — the airy, two-line-leading variant used in hero subtext |
| `{typography.body-strong}` | 16px | 600 | 1.5 | 0 | Emphasized body run, lead sentence |
| `{typography.body-md}` | 16px | 500 | 1.5 | 0 | Default UI body, table cells, form labels |
| `{typography.eyebrow}` | 15px | 500 | 1.4 | 0 | Section eyebrow above large headings, all-caps |
| `{typography.button-cap}` | 14px | 700 | 1.14 | 0.2px | Filled button labels (uppercase) |
| `{typography.button-cap-light}` | 14px | 500 | 1.29 | 0.2px | Ghost / outline button labels (uppercase) |
| `{typography.caption}` | 14px | 400 | 1.43 | 0 | Footer text, fine print, helper copy |
| `{typography.micro-cap}` | 10px | 600 | 1.8 | 0.25px | Status labels, badge text, micro-eyebrow |
| `{typography.code}` | 16px | 400 | 1.5 | 0 | Code block content |
| `{typography.code-strong}` | 16px | 700 | 1.5 | 0 | Highlighted code keyword |

### Principles
- **Two leading worlds.** Marketing copy uses 2.0 line-height on `{typography.body-lg}` — extremely airy, generous breathing room. Functional UI copy uses 1.5 line-height on `{typography.body-md}` — denser, closer to console output. The choice is deliberate: marketing reads like prose, the product reads like a log.
- **Caps with tracking.** All button labels and eyebrows are uppercase with 0.2px tracking. This is the brand''s typographic signature — a console-prompt cadence applied to UI affordances.
- **Headlines as syntax.** The hero display is structured so a single keyword can be wrapped in a `{colors.accent-lime}` highlight chip without disrupting the reading order. Treat the lime chip as a glyph-level decoration, not a separate component.

### Note on Font Substitutes
Rubik is open-source on Google Fonts and is the safe default for everything except the hero display. For the proprietary display sans, suitable open substitutes are **Space Grotesk** (heavier weights), **Archivo** (semi-condensed weights), or **Hubot Sans** with optical-size axis at heavier ends — all carry the same chunky, near-condensed silhouette. Adjust line-height down by 0.05 when substituting, since the proprietary face has tighter leading at large sizes.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/sentry/DESIGN.md","category":"typography"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 3),

### Spacing System
- **Base unit**: 8px
- **Tokens**: `{spacing.xxs}` 2px · `{spacing.xs}` 4px · `{spacing.sm}` 8px · `{spacing.md}` 12px · `{spacing.lg}` 16px · `{spacing.xl}` 24px · `{spacing.xxl}` 32px · `{spacing.section}` 96px
- **Section padding**: `{spacing.section}` 96px between major page bands on desktop, collapsing to `{spacing.xxl}` 32px–48px on mobile.
- **Card internal padding**: `{spacing.xxl}` 32px on pricing cards and large feature cards; `{spacing.lg}` 16px on compact tag/badge groups.
- **Form field padding**: `{spacing.sm}` 8px vertical, `{spacing.md}` 12px horizontal — matches the text-input token directly.

### Grid & Container
- Marketing pages use a wide centered container with generous outer gutters; max width sits around 1152px (one of the extracted breakpoints), with content inside flexing across 12 conceptual columns.
- Pricing splits into a 4-tier card row at desktop, collapsing to 2-up at mid widths and 1-up on mobile.
- The contact form uses a 2-column field layout (first/last name side-by-side) inside a single light-canvas panel.
- Breakpoints stair-step at 1440 → 1152 → 992 → 768 → 640 → 576 — see Responsive Behavior.

### Whitespace Philosophy
The dark canvas absorbs whitespace differently from light. On dark surfaces the brand stretches `{spacing.section}` generously between bands so floating mascots and starfield textures have room to breathe. On light surfaces (pricing, contact) the whitespace tightens — content density takes priority because users are scanning, comparing, and acting. Rule of thumb: hero and feature surfaces are spacious, transactional surfaces are dense.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/sentry/DESIGN.md","category":"layout"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 4),

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Flat on canvas, no shadow | Default surface, dark or light |
| 1 | `box-shadow: rgba(0,0,0,0.08) 0 2px 8px 0` | Inverted buttons on dark canvas (light fill lifting off dark surface) |
| 2 | `box-shadow: rgba(0,0,0,0.1) 0 10px 15px -3px, rgba(0,0,0,0.1) 0 4px 6px -4px` | Floating cards on light canvas, modals |
| 3 | `box-shadow: rgb(21,15,35) 0 0 8px 6px` | Glow halo around primary CTA on dark hero — the dark color itself becomes the shadow, creating a vignette of canvas around the button |

### Decorative Depth
Sentri''s depth doesn''t come from drop shadows — it comes from the **starfield texture** on the hero canvas (subtle white-on-violet pinpricks at low opacity), the **floating sticker mascots** (drawn with hand-rendered outlines and saturated fills, layered above the canvas with no shadow), and the **lime squiggly divider** above the footer. These illustrative elements do the work that shadow stacks do in flatter design systems — they tell the eye where one section ends and another begins.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/sentry/DESIGN.md","category":"elevation"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 5),

### Photography Geometry
The site doesn''t use traditional photography — it uses **illustrated stickers and product UI screenshots** in roughly equivalent geometric roles. Product UI mocks sit inside `{rounded.xxl}` 18px containers, often tilted slightly off-axis, against the dark canvas with no border. Sticker mascots have no container at all — they are layered directly on canvas, often overlapping section boundaries to break the grid. Avatar treatments (in customer-logo strips) are simple greyscale wordmarks, not photos.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/sentry/DESIGN.md","category":"shapes"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 6),

> **No hover states documented.** Every spec below shows only Default and Pressed/Active states. Variants are formal entries in the front-matter `components:` block.

### Buttons

**`button-primary`** — the dominant CTA across light surfaces.
- Background `{colors.primary}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.button-cap}` (uppercase, 14px / 700, 0.2px tracking), padding `{spacing.md} {spacing.lg}` (12px 16px), rounded `{rounded.md}`. On dark hero surfaces, add the level-3 glow halo for emphasis.
- Pressed state lives in `button-primary-pressed`: background flips to `{colors.surface-press-stronger}`, text to `{colors.ink-press}`. The button effectively swaps polarities on press.

**`button-inverted`** — the dominant CTA on dark canvas; visually identical hierarchy, polarity-flipped.
- Background `{colors.on-primary}` (white), text `{colors.ink-deep}`, same `{typography.button-cap}`, rounded `{rounded.md}`.
- Pressed in `button-inverted-pressed`: background drops to `{colors.surface-press-light}`, text to `{colors.ink-press}`.

**`button-ghost-on-dark`** — secondary CTA on dark canvas (e.g., "Get Demo" beside "Get Started").
- Translucent fill `{colors.on-dark-faint}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.button-cap}`, padding `{spacing.sm}` (8px), rounded `{rounded.xl}`. The translucent fill lets the canvas texture show through.

**`button-violet-token`** — pill-shaped tag/category button used inline in product navs.
- Background `{colors.accent-violet-mid}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.button-cap-light}`, padding `{spacing.sm} {spacing.lg}` (8px 16px), rounded `{rounded.xl}`, 1px hairline border in a slightly deeper violet.

**`button-disabled`**
- Background `{colors.hairline-cloud}`, text `{colors.on-dark-muted}`, otherwise identical to `button-primary`.

### Cards & Containers

**`card-pricing`** — the standard tier card on the pricing page.
- Background `{colors.surface-canvas-light}`, text `{colors.ink-deep}`, padding `{spacing.xxl}` 32px, rounded `{rounded.xl}` 12px, 1px `{colors.hairline-cloud}` border. Headline at top in `{typography.heading-md}`, price in `{typography.display-large}`, feature list in `{typography.body-md}`, primary CTA pinned to the bottom of the card.

**`card-pricing-featured`** — the dark inverted "featured" tier (Sentri uses the Business tier as the featured one).
- Background `{colors.surface-night}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, otherwise identical structure to `card-pricing`. The inversion (rather than an accent-bordered light card) is the brand''s distinctive choice — the featured tier reads as the brand''s voice, not as a marketing decoration.

**`card-feature-dark`** — large feature-band card on dark surfaces, used to anchor product feature explanations.
- Background `{colors.ink-deep}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, padding `{spacing.xxl}` 32px, rounded `{rounded.xxl}` 18px. Often holds a UI mock plus a 27px headline plus 16px body.

**`card-spotlight-violet`** — accent feature card with deeper violet fill, used for "Sentry-only" capability bands.
- Background `{colors.accent-violet-deep}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, padding `{spacing.xxl}`, rounded `{rounded.xxl}`. The deep violet reads as a feature highlight without breaking out of the brand''s purple family.

**`code-block`** — code/install snippets.
- Background `{colors.surface-night}`, text `{colors.on-primary}` rendered in `{typography.code}`. Padding `{spacing.lg}` 16px, rounded `{rounded.md}`. On dark canvas the code block is barely lifted from canvas — only the slightly deeper fill differentiates it.

### Inputs & Forms

**`text-input`** — the contact-form first/last/email/etc. fields.
- Background `{colors.surface-canvas-light}`, text `{colors.ink-deep}`, type `{typography.body-md}`, padding `{spacing.sm} {spacing.md}` (8px 12px), rounded `{rounded.sm}` 6px, 1px `{colors.hairline-cool}` border.
- Focus state in `text-input-focused`: same fill, but adds an inset shadow `rgba(0,0,0,0.15) 0 2px 10px inset` to suggest depth pressed inward.

**`select-violet`** — the dropdown variant used inside dark contact panels.
- Background `{colors.accent-violet-deep}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.body-md}`, padding `{spacing.sm} {spacing.lg}`, rounded `{rounded.md}`. Distinctive because it doesn''t mimic a plain text input — it reads as a deliberate brand surface.

### Navigation

**`nav-bar-light`** — the standard top nav across light pages (pricing, contact, docs).
- Background `{colors.surface-canvas-light}`, text `{colors.ink-deep}`, type `{typography.body-md}`. Logo wordmark on the left at ~145×32px, primary nav items mid-bar with dropdown carets, and a `Get Demo` ghost + `Get Started` filled `button-primary` pair on the right. Padding `{spacing.lg} {spacing.xl}` (16px 24px).

**Top Nav (dark variant)** — used on the home page; same structure but inverted polarity, sitting on `{colors.surface-canvas-dark}`. The right-side button becomes `button-inverted`.

**Mobile nav** — collapses to a hamburger toggle below the 768px breakpoint; dropdown carets become full-width accordion items.

### Pills, Badges, and Highlight Chips

**`pill-neutral-dark`** — small status / category pill on dark surfaces.
- Background `{colors.surface-night}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.caption}` 12px, padding `{spacing.xs} {spacing.sm}` (4px 8px), rounded `{rounded.xs}` 4px.

**`chip-lime-keyword`** — the signature inline highlight wrapping single words inside the hero display headline.
- Background `{colors.accent-lime}`, text `{colors.ink-deep}`, type matches the surrounding `{typography.display-hero}`, rounded `{rounded.xs}` 4px, padding `0 {spacing.md}` (12px horizontal, 0 vertical so the chip hugs the cap-height).

### Signature Components

**Sticker Mascot Layer** — illustrated characters (astronauts, cartoon monsters, traffic cones, debugging avatars) drawn with hand-rendered outlines and saturated `{colors.accent-pink}` / `{colors.accent-lime}` fills. Mascots are placed at section junctions, often overlapping section boundaries by 30–40% of their height, with no container or shadow. They function as decorative section markers and brand personality carriers — never inside cards, never as buttons.

**Lime Squiggly Footer Divider** — a hand-drawn `{colors.accent-lime}` squiggle line, ~3px stroke, sitting above the footer at full container width. Replaces what would otherwise be a 1px hairline divider with a personality-laden flourish.

**Starfield Hero Texture** — a faint white-on-violet pinprick pattern overlaid on the hero canvas at very low opacity. Adds atmospheric depth to the dark canvas without visible decoration. Implemented as a background image, not as repeating CSS.

**Window-Chrome UI Mock** — product UI screenshots framed in `{rounded.xxl}` containers, often tilted ±2–3 degrees off axis, positioned overlapping section boundaries on the dark feature pages. The chrome itself is just a rounded image with a subtle hairline; the content is the actual product UI.

**`link-on-dark`** — inline links in body copy on dark surfaces. Default text is `{colors.on-primary}` rendered in `{typography.body-md}` with a persistent underline; the underline is the entire affordance, no color change. Sits flush in copy with no padding, no rounded corners beyond the inherited `{rounded.xs}`.

**`link-on-light`** — inline links in body copy on light surfaces. Same shape contract as `link-on-dark`, but text is `{colors.ink-deep}`. Used across pricing, contact, and docs surfaces.

**`footer-light`** — site-wide footer on the light-canvas template (pricing, contact, docs).
- Background `{colors.surface-canvas-light}`, text `{colors.ink-deep}`, type `{typography.caption}`, padding `{spacing.xxl} {spacing.xl}` (32px 24px). Topped by the lime squiggly divider — see Signature Components. Holds three to four columns of link groups, social icons in a horizontal strip at the bottom right, and a small legal/copyright row at the very bottom in `{typography.caption}`.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/sentry/DESIGN.md","category":"components"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 7),
((select id from d), 'dos_and_donts', 'Do''s and Don''ts', 'dos_and_donts', '## Do''s and Don''ts

### Do
- Reserve `{colors.accent-lime}` for keyword-highlight chips inside display headlines and the footer squiggle divider — never use it as a button background, never as body text.
- Pair every `button-primary` with `{typography.button-cap}` in uppercase with 0.2px tracking — the cadence is part of the brand, not a stylistic option.
- Treat the dark canvas (`{colors.surface-canvas-dark}`) and light canvas (`{colors.surface-canvas-light}`) as two complete worlds — let one own marketing/feature pages and the other own transactional pages, with no half-measures.
- Use sticker mascots to break section boundaries — let them overlap, tilt, and float; constraining them inside cards drains their personality.
- Use `card-pricing-featured` (dark inverted tier) instead of an accent-bordered light tier for the featured pricing column.
- Default body line-height to 1.5 on functional UI surfaces and 2.0 on marketing surfaces — the difference is intentional.

### Don''t
- Don''t introduce additional accent colors beyond `{colors.accent-lime}` and `{colors.accent-pink}` — adding teal, orange, or yellow dilutes the violet-and-lime signature.
- Don''t apply drop shadows to cards on dark canvas — depth comes from texture and illustration, not from light-on-dark shadows that would muddy the violet.
- Don''t use `{typography.display-hero}` (88px) for anything except the marketing hero — even sub-pages cap at `{typography.display-large}` (60px).
- Don''t put body text in `{colors.accent-lime}` — it''s a chip color, not a type color, and breaks contrast at body sizes.
- Don''t soften the `{colors.primary}` button to a brand-violet — the near-black is the point; it reads as the most authoritative action regardless of canvas polarity.
- Don''t put illustrated mascots inside cards or constrained containers — their job is to break grid, not occupy it.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/sentry/DESIGN.md","category":"dos_and_donts"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 8),

### Breakpoints

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| 4K / Wide | ≥ 1440px | Full 4-tier pricing row, hero illustration sits beside headline at full scale |
| Desktop | 1152–1440px | Default content max-width sits at 1152px, all 4-tier patterns hold |
| Laptop | 992–1151px | Pricing collapses to 2-up rows, nav remains horizontal |
| Tablet | 768–991px | 2-column feature grids collapse to 1-up; nav still horizontal but compresses |
| Mobile Large | 640–767px | Hamburger nav appears; hero display drops from 88px to ~56px |
| Mobile | 576–639px | Single-column everything; section padding collapses from 96px to 32–48px |
| Small Mobile | 1–575px | Compact mode; sticker mascots drop in size or hide entirely to preserve content priority |

### Touch Targets
- Primary buttons hit a minimum 44×44px on mobile (12px vertical padding × 16px font + line-height = ~44px). Maintains WCAG AAA touch-target spec.
- Pill tags and badges in nav and feature surfaces stay above 32×32px even at small mobile breakpoints; they enlarge if necessary rather than shrink.
- Form fields stay at the 44px minimum height on mobile contact pages.

### Collapsing Strategy
- **Hero display headline** drops from 88px → 60px → 48px across the breakpoint stair; the lime keyword chip preserves padding and corner radius at every step.
- **Pricing tiers** stair-step from 4-up → 2-up → 1-up. The featured dark tier always remains visually distinguished — it never loses its inversion at any breakpoint.
- **Sticker mascots** are progressively de-emphasized: at desktop they overlap section boundaries; at tablet they shift to inline within section padding; at small mobile most are hidden via `display: none` to keep the content scan-able.
- **Top nav** collapses to a hamburger below 768px; the dropdown menu uses the same canvas polarity as the page (dark on hero, light on pricing).
- **Code blocks** preserve 16px Monaco at every breakpoint — they never scale down — but switch to horizontal scroll on overflow rather than wrap.

### Image Behavior
- Product UI mocks scale proportionally; on small mobile they often anchor to one edge with horizontal overflow rather than shrink to illegibility.
- Sticker mascots scale by 50–70% at mobile breakpoints, preserving their personality but ceding screen space to content.
- The lime footer squiggle scales the SVG to container width while keeping stroke width visually consistent.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/sentry/DESIGN.md","category":"responsive_guidelines"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 9),

1. Focus on ONE component at a time. Don''t rebuild the system — extend it.
2. Reference component names and tokens directly (`{colors.accent-lime}`, `{button-primary}-pressed`, `{rounded.xxl}`) — do not paraphrase.
3. Run `npx @google/design.md lint DESIGN.md` after edits — `broken-ref`, `contrast-ratio`, and `orphaned-tokens` warnings flag issues automatically.
4. Add new variants as separate component entries (`-pressed`, `-disabled`, `-focused`) — do not bury them inside prose.
5. Default to `{typography.body-md}` for product UI body and `{typography.body-lg}` for marketing prose — the leading difference is intentional and load-bearing.

description: An inspired interpretation of Shopifi''s design language — a cinematic commerce platform that runs two parallel design tracks. The marketing-hero and product-narrative pages live on near-black canvases with full-bleed photography of merchants, giant Neue Haas Grotesk display type at thin weights, and a single black-pill CTA stroked in white. The transactional pages (pricing, signup, dashboards) flip to a cream-mint canvas with pastel aloe and pistachio greens, the same pill button vocabulary, and Inter for UI body. The two tracks share typographic DNA but diverge sharply in canvas polarity — and that choice is the brand.

## Overview

Shopifi runs two parallel design tracks that share typographic DNA and a single button vocabulary, but diverge in canvas polarity. The marketing track lives on `{colors.canvas-night}` (`#000000`) — full-bleed cinematic photography of merchants, giant `{typography.display-xxl}` headlines in Neue Haas Grotesk Display set at weight 330 (a thin, almost editorial cut), and a single CTA: a white-stroked black pill with the form `button-outline-on-dark`. The pages read like the spread of a high-end print magazine: lots of black, lots of negative space, photography that doesn''t compete with text, and one and only one action per band.

The transactional track flips to `{colors.canvas-light}` and `{colors.canvas-cream}` (an off-white that''s barely warmer than pure white). Pricing tiers, comparison tables, and signup flows sit on this lighter canvas, with the same pill button system but in inverse polarity (a solid black pill with white text, or a `{colors.aloe-10}` mint pill for the featured / "Start free trial" tier). The accents — `{colors.aloe-10}` mint and `{colors.pistachio-10}` pistachio — show up only on the light track, never on the cinematic dark hero pages.

Typography is split across three families. **Neue Haas Grotesk Display** at thin weights (330–500) handles every display, headline, and editorial moment — the brand''s identity is that thin display cut. **Inter Variable** at 420–550 weights handles every UI body, button label, caption, and form field — utility text that doesn''t fight the display. **ui-monospace** appears only in code blocks and rare technical eyebrows. Across all three families, the OpenType `ss03` stylistic set is enabled — it''s the brand''s character-level signature, applied universally.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Two-canvas system: `{colors.canvas-night}` for cinematic marketing, `{colors.canvas-light}` / `{colors.canvas-cream}` for transactional surfaces — never blended.
- Pill-shape (`{rounded.pill}`) is the only button shape across both tracks; rounded rectangles do not exist for buttons.
- Thin-weight (330) display typography is the signature; `{typography.display-xxl}` at 96px / weight 330 is the brand''s loudest visual.
- Aloe and pistachio greens (`{colors.aloe-10}`, `{colors.pistachio-10}`) are reserved for the light track — they signal commerce, growth, transactional success.
- Photography is full-bleed, edge-to-edge, never inset in cards on the cinematic track; merchants and storefront imagery do the heavy visual lifting that gradients and illustrations would do elsewhere.
- The OpenType `ss03` stylistic set is enabled across every text role — a character-level unifier that tracks across both tracks.
- Tight letter-spacing on display sizes (2.4px positive tracking on 96px display) gives the thin weight extra optical air.

## Colors

> **Source pages:** home (`/`), `/start`, `/website/builder`, `/pricing`.

### Brand & Accent
- **Aloe** (`{colors.aloe-10}` — `#c1fbd4`): The featured-tier and "growth" accent. Used as a pill button background on light surfaces and as a feature-card fill in the pricing comparison band.
- **Pistachio** (`{colors.pistachio-10}` — `#d4f9e0`): Softer than aloe; used as a wide section band fill on the light track to signal a different category of feature without leaving the green family.
- **Cool Link Tones** (`{colors.link-cool-1}` `#9dabad`, `{colors.link-cool-2}` `#9797a2`, `{colors.link-cool-3}` `#bdbdca`, `{colors.link-mint}` `#99b3ad`): Muted footer / tertiary link colors used on dark surfaces to create a quiet hierarchy below the primary white type.

### Surface
- **Canvas Night** (`{colors.canvas-night}` — `#000000`): Pure black hero, cinematic feature pages, footer.
- **Canvas Night Elevated** (`{colors.canvas-night-elevated}` — `#0a0a0a`): Cards on cinematic surfaces, video frames.
- **Surface Elevated Dark** (`{colors.surface-elevated-dark}` — `#1e2c31`): Dark teal-shifted surface used on a small subset of dark cards to introduce subtle depth without breaking the black.
- **Canvas Light** (`{colors.canvas-light}` — `#ffffff`): Pricing, signup, comparison tables.
- **Canvas Cream** (`{colors.canvas-cream}` — `#fbfbf5`): Slightly warm off-white used on the pricing-page background canvas — invisibly different from `#ffffff` but adds editorial warmth.
- **Hairline Light** (`{colors.hairline-light}` — `#e4e4e7`): 1px borders on light cards, table dividers.
- **Hairline Dark** (`{colors.hairline-dark}` — `#1e2c31`): 1px borders on the rare dark cards that have visible chrome.

### Shade Ladder
- **Shade-30** (`{colors.shade-30}` — `#d4d4d8`): Tag / chip background on light, footer hairline on dark.
- **Shade-40** (`{colors.shade-40}` — `#a1a1aa`): Tertiary text on light, secondary text on dark.
- **Shade-50** (`{colors.shade-50}` — `#71717a`): Secondary text on light.
- **Shade-60** (`{colors.shade-60}` — `#52525b`): Tertiary text on light, deep on dark.
- **Shade-70** (`{colors.shade-70}` — `#3f3f46`): Pressed-state of the primary pill button; deep dark surface accent.

### Text
- **Ink** (`{colors.ink}` — `#000000`): All text on light canvas.
- **On Primary** (`{colors.on-primary}` — `#ffffff`): All text on dark canvas + filled-pill labels.

## Typography

### Font Family

The display tier is **Neue Haas Grotesk Display** at thin weights (330–500). When unavailable, fall back to **Helvetica** at light weight, then Arial. The thin-weight cut is the brand — no substitution should default to weight 400+.

The UI tier is **Inter Variable** at 420–550 — a variable font with sub-weight precision that lets the system span body (420), strong (550), and caption (500) without jumping to heavier tiers. Inter is open-source via Google Fonts.

The code tier is **ui-monospace**, the system mono — preferred over a webfont mono to avoid unnecessary downloads.

The OpenType `ss03` stylistic set is enabled across every role. It alters specific glyph forms (lowercase `a`, `g`, single-story numerals) for a slightly more geometric character. Apply via `font-feature-settings: "ss03"` on the body element or root.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-xxl}` | 96px | 330 | 1.0 | 2.4px | Cinematic hero headline |
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 70px | 330 | 1.0 | 0 | Section opener on cinematic pages |
| `{typography.display-lg}` | 55px | 330 | 1.16 | 0 | Pricing-page page title |
| `{typography.display-md}` | 48px | 330 | 1.14 | 0 | Sub-section headline on light track |
| `{typography.heading-xl}` | 28px | 500 | 1.28 | 0.42px | Card title / pricing tier name |
| `{typography.heading-lg}` | 24px | 400 | 1.14 | 0.36px | Compact card title |
| `{typography.heading-md}` | 20px | 500 | 1.4 | 0.3px | Section sub-heading |
| `{typography.heading-sm}` | 18px | 500 | 1.25 | 0.72px | Eyebrow / mini-section label |
| `{typography.body-lg}` | 18px | 550 | 1.56 | 0 | Marketing body lead, large body |
| `{typography.body-md}` | 16px | 420 | 1.5 | 0 | Default UI body, pill-button labels |
| `{typography.body-strong}` | 16px | 550 | 1.5 | 0 | Emphasized body run |
| `{typography.caption}` | 14px | 500 | 1.49 | 0.28px | Helper copy, footnotes |
| `{typography.micro}` | 13px | 500 | 1.5 | -0.13px | Pricing fine print |
| `{typography.eyebrow-cap}` | 12px | 400 | 1.2 | 0.72px | All-caps eyebrow above large headlines |
| `{typography.code}` | 16px | 400 | 1.5 | 0 | Code blocks |

### Principles
- **Display thinness is the brand.** Always render display sizes at weight 330 — never 400+. The thinness is a deliberate editorial choice that makes the giant size feel quiet.
- **Display in NHGD, body in Inter.** Don''t push body roles up to NHGD; don''t push display roles down to Inter.
- **Tracking lifts on display.** The 96px hero gets +2.4px positive tracking — the thin glyphs need air. At 70px and below, tracking returns to 0.

### Note on Font Substitutes
Open substitutes for Neue Haas Grotesk Display: **Helvetica Now Display** (proprietary) or **Inter Display** at light weights (open-source) are the closest matches. Avoid Helvetica Neue at default weight — it''s too heavy for the brand''s thin tier. **Inter Variable** is open-source via Google Fonts and is the canonical body face — no substitute needed.

## Layout

### Spacing System
- **Base unit**: 8px (with denser sub-units 1, 2, 3, 4 for fine work).
- **Tokens**: `{spacing.xxs}` 2px · `{spacing.xs}` 4px · `{spacing.sm}` 8px · `{spacing.md}` 12px · `{spacing.lg}` 16px · `{spacing.xl}` 24px · `{spacing.xxl}` 32px · `{spacing.huge}` 64px.
- **Section padding**: `{spacing.huge}` 64–128px on cinematic marketing pages (extreme negative space is the point); collapses to ~48px on transactional pages where density takes priority.
- **Card internal padding**: `{spacing.xxl}` 32px on pricing cards; `{spacing.xl}` 24px on compact tag rows.

### Grid & Container
- Cinematic hero pages use a wide max-width container (~1440–1600px) with edge-bleeding photography that escapes the container.
- Pricing collapses through 4-up → 2-up → 1-up tiers based on viewport.
- Body content centers in a ~720–840px reading column on long-form pages.

### Whitespace Philosophy
The cinematic track treats whitespace as the brand''s most valuable asset — sections often have 128–192px of vertical air between content blocks, with photography filling the rest. The transactional track tightens to ~48–64px between bands because users are scanning, comparing, and acting. The contrast between the two whitespace philosophies is part of the brand voice.

## Elevation & Depth

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Flat, no shadow | Default surface |
| 1 | `0 1px 2px rgba(255,255,255,0.05), inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.04)` | Subtle inset highlight on dark cards (a top-edge sheen) |
| 2 | `0 0 0 1px rgba(255,255,255,0.08), 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.3), 0 5px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)` | Dark elevated cards with hairline + drop shadow stack |
| 3 | `0 8px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1), 0 4px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1), 0 2px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1), 0 0 0 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)` | Stacked-shadow card on light surfaces; layered tiny shadows produce a soft halo |
| 4 | `0 25px 50px -12px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)` | Modal / floating panel on light |

### Decorative Depth
On the cinematic track, depth comes from photography — full-bleed merchant imagery layered behind cards, with subtle inset top-edge highlights creating the illusion of light hitting a glass surface. On the light track, the layered tiny-shadow stack (Level 3) produces a soft, paper-like halo around pricing cards — depth without harshness.

## Shapes

### Border Radius Scale

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{rounded.xs}` | 4px | Inputs, hairline tags |
| `{rounded.sm}` | 5px | Image containers (small) |
| `{rounded.md}` | 8px | Form inputs, video frames, smaller cards |
| `{rounded.lg}` | 12px | Pricing cards, feature cards |
| `{rounded.xl}` | 20px (top-only on some asymmetric cards) | Hero photo frames, cinematic card chrome |
| `{rounded.pill}` | 9999px | All buttons, pill tags, mint chips |

### Photography Geometry
Photography is full-bleed with no border. On cinematic pages it escapes the container entirely; on transactional pages it sits inside `{rounded.lg}` containers with no shadow. Avatar treatments in customer-logo strips are simple greyscale wordmarks at uniform height (~24–32px), aligned in a single horizontal strip.

## Components

### Buttons

**`button-primary-pill`** — the dominant CTA across the system.
- Background `{colors.primary}` (black), text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.body-md}`, padding `{spacing.md} {spacing.xl}` (12px 24px), rounded `{rounded.pill}` 9999px.
- Pressed state `button-primary-pill-pressed`: background lifts to `{colors.shade-70}`.

**`button-outline-on-dark`** — the cinematic hero CTA.
- Background `{colors.canvas-night}` (transparent on the canvas), 2px solid `{colors.on-primary}` border, text `{colors.on-primary}`, same pill geometry.

**`button-outline-on-light`** — the light-track equivalent.
- Background `{colors.canvas-light}`, 1px solid `{colors.ink}` border, text `{colors.ink}`, same pill geometry.

**`button-aloe-pill`** — the featured CTA on pricing pages.
- Background `{colors.aloe-10}`, text `{colors.ink}`, same pill geometry. Used for the "Start free trial" tier.

### Cards & Containers

**`card-pricing`** — the standard tier card on the pricing page.
- Background `{colors.canvas-light}`, padding `{spacing.xxl}`, rounded `{rounded.lg}` 12px, 1px `{colors.hairline-light}` border. Title in `{typography.heading-xl}`, price in `{typography.display-md}`, body in `{typography.body-md}`, CTA pinned to the bottom as `button-primary-pill`.

**`card-pricing-featured`** — the highlighted pricing tier.
- Background `{colors.aloe-10}`, otherwise identical to `card-pricing`. The mint fill (rather than a brand-color border) is the brand''s distinctive featured-tier choice.

**`card-feature-cinematic`** — feature card on the cinematic track.
- Background `{colors.canvas-night-elevated}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, rounded `{rounded.lg}`, often with a top-edge inset highlight (Level 1 elevation). Holds full-bleed photography or a single large statement.

**`card-pistachio-band`** — wide horizontal band card used to highlight a category of features on the light track.
- Background `{colors.pistachio-10}`, text `{colors.ink}`, rounded `{rounded.lg}` 12px, padding `{spacing.xxl}`.

**`card-photo-frame`** — full-bleed photography container on cinematic pages.
- Background `{colors.canvas-night}`, padding 0, rounded `{rounded.xl}` 20px (often top-only). The photo IS the content; no inner padding, no overlay text inside the card.

### Inputs & Forms

**`text-input`** — standard text input on light surfaces.
- Background `{colors.canvas-light}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.body-md}`, padding `{spacing.sm}+ {spacing.md}` (10px 12px), rounded `{rounded.md}` 8px, 1px `{colors.hairline-light}` border.

### Navigation

**`nav-bar-light`** — top nav on light pages.
- Background `{colors.canvas-light}`, text `{colors.ink}`, padding `{spacing.lg} {spacing.xl}`. Logo wordmark on the left, nav items center, two pill buttons on the right (`button-outline-on-light` for "Log in", `button-primary-pill` for "Start free trial").

**`nav-bar-dark`** — top nav on cinematic pages.
- Background `{colors.canvas-night}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, otherwise identical structure. Two pill buttons on the right (`button-outline-on-dark` for both, with the rightmost subtly more prominent via type weight).

### Pills, Tags, and Chips

**`pill-tag-mint`** — small tag on light surfaces, signaling a feature category.
- Background `{colors.aloe-10}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.eyebrow-cap}`, padding `{spacing.xs} {spacing.md}`, rounded `{rounded.pill}`.

**`pill-tag-shade`** — neutral tag on light surfaces.
- Background `{colors.shade-30}`, text `{colors.ink}`, otherwise same shape as `pill-tag-mint`.

### Signature Components

**Cinematic Photography Layer** — full-bleed merchant photos on the hero. No overlay scrim, no text-on-image; instead, the type sits in clean negative space above or below the photo. The brand treats photography as an editorial spread, not as decoration.

**Stacked Tiny Shadows (Level 3 Elevation)** — pricing cards on the light track use 4 stacked tiny drop shadows (each 1–8px Y offset, 10% black) to produce a soft, layered paper halo. This is the brand''s distinctive depth on light.

**`link-on-dark`** — inline link on cinematic pages.
- Color `{colors.on-primary}`, no underline by default (links rely on context); for tertiary footer links, color shifts to one of the cool muted tones (`{colors.link-cool-1}` etc.) with a persistent underline.

**`footer-dark`** — full-page-width footer on the cinematic track.
- Background `{colors.canvas-night}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.caption}`, padding `{spacing.huge} {spacing.xl}`. Contains 4–5 columns of muted-tone link groups, social icons, and a small legal row.

**`footer-light`** — equivalent on the transactional track.
- Background `{colors.canvas-light}`, text `{colors.ink}`, otherwise same structure.

## Do''s and Don''ts

### Do
- Reserve `{colors.aloe-10}` and `{colors.pistachio-10}` for the light track only — they don''t appear on cinematic black pages.
- Always use `{rounded.pill}` for buttons; never `{rounded.md}` or `{rounded.lg}`.
- Render display tiers at weight 330; bumping to 400 or 500 breaks the brand''s thin-display signature.
- Use full-bleed photography on cinematic pages — let it escape the container.
- Apply `font-feature-settings: "ss03"` globally; the stylistic set is the brand''s typographic signature.
- Pair black canvas with white type and white-stroked outline pills; pair light canvas with black type and filled-black pills.

### Don''t
- Don''t introduce a third canvas color — stick to black or light/cream. Greys, beiges, and blues are not in the system.
- Don''t add drop shadows on cinematic dark cards beyond the subtle inset top-highlight; the cinematic track wants flat blackness.
- Don''t shrink display tiers below `{typography.display-md}` (48px) on hero surfaces; below that they read as section heads, not display.
- Don''t put aloe / pistachio greens behind type — they''re surface fills, not text colors.
- Don''t replace the pill shape with a rounded-rectangle button anywhere.

## Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Wide | ≥ 1440px | Full cinematic hero with edge-bleeding photography; pricing 4-up |
| Desktop | 1024–1440px | Default content max-width; pricing 4-up tightens |
| Tablet | 768–1023px | Pricing 2-up; cinematic hero photography crops |
| Mobile | < 768px | Pricing 1-up; hamburger nav; display-xxl drops to ~56–64px |

### Touch Targets
- Pill buttons hit ≥ 44×44px on mobile via 12px vertical padding × 16px line-height. WCAG AAA compliant.
- Form fields stay at the 44px minimum height across all breakpoints.

### Collapsing Strategy
- Display sizes scale down through the breakpoint stair: 96 → 70 → 55 → 48 → 36px on mobile.
- Cinematic photography crops aggressively at smaller widths, prioritizing focal subject over edge-bleed.
- Pricing tiers stair-step 4-up → 2-up → 1-up; the featured aloe tier stays visually distinguished at every step.
- Top nav collapses to hamburger below 768px; menu inherits canvas polarity.

### Image Behavior
Photography uses responsive `srcset` with art-direction crops at major breakpoints. Mobile crops favor close subjects; wide crops favor environmental / storefront context.

## Iteration Guide

1. Focus on ONE component at a time.
2. Reference component names and tokens directly (`{colors.aloe-10}`, `{button-primary-pill}-pressed`, `{rounded.pill}`).
3. Run `npx @google/design.md lint DESIGN.md` after edits.
4. Add new variants as separate entries.
5. Default body to `{typography.body-md}`; reserve `{typography.body-lg}` for marketing leads.
6. Keep the two canvas tracks separated — when designing a new page, choose cinematic OR transactional, not both.
7. The pill shape is non-negotiable; new button variants vary in fill / border / canvas, never in shape.

- **Pistachio** (`{colors.pistachio-10}` — `#d4f9e0`): Softer than aloe; used as a wide section band fill on the light track to signal a different category of feature without leaving the green family.
- **Cool Link Tones** (`{colors.link-cool-1}` `#9dabad`, `{colors.link-cool-2}` `#9797a2`, `{colors.link-cool-3}` `#bdbdca`, `{colors.link-mint}` `#99b3ad`): Muted footer / tertiary link colors used on dark surfaces to create a quiet hierarchy below the primary white type.

### Surface
- **Canvas Night** (`{colors.canvas-night}` — `#000000`): Pure black hero, cinematic feature pages, footer.
- **Canvas Night Elevated** (`{colors.canvas-night-elevated}` — `#0a0a0a`): Cards on cinematic surfaces, video frames.
- **Surface Elevated Dark** (`{colors.surface-elevated-dark}` — `#1e2c31`): Dark teal-shifted surface used on a small subset of dark cards to introduce subtle depth without breaking the black.
- **Canvas Light** (`{colors.canvas-light}` — `#ffffff`): Pricing, signup, comparison tables.
- **Canvas Cream** (`{colors.canvas-cream}` — `#fbfbf5`): Slightly warm off-white used on the pricing-page background canvas — invisibly different from `#ffffff` but adds editorial warmth.
- **Hairline Light** (`{colors.hairline-light}` — `#e4e4e7`): 1px borders on light cards, table dividers.
- **Hairline Dark** (`{colors.hairline-dark}` — `#1e2c31`): 1px borders on the rare dark cards that have visible chrome.

### Shade Ladder
- **Shade-30** (`{colors.shade-30}` — `#d4d4d8`): Tag / chip background on light, footer hairline on dark.
- **Shade-40** (`{colors.shade-40}` — `#a1a1aa`): Tertiary text on light, secondary text on dark.
- **Shade-50** (`{colors.shade-50}` — `#71717a`): Secondary text on light.
- **Shade-60** (`{colors.shade-60}` — `#52525b`): Tertiary text on light, deep on dark.
- **Shade-70** (`{colors.shade-70}` — `#3f3f46`): Pressed-state of the primary pill button; deep dark surface accent.

### Text
- **Ink** (`{colors.ink}` — `#000000`): All text on light canvas.
- **On Primary** (`{colors.on-primary}` — `#ffffff`): All text on dark canvas + filled-pill labels.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/shopify/DESIGN.md","category":"colors"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 2),

### Font Family

The display tier is **Neue Haas Grotesk Display** at thin weights (330–500). When unavailable, fall back to **Helvetica** at light weight, then Arial. The thin-weight cut is the brand — no substitution should default to weight 400+.

The UI tier is **Inter Variable** at 420–550 — a variable font with sub-weight precision that lets the system span body (420), strong (550), and caption (500) without jumping to heavier tiers. Inter is open-source via Google Fonts.

The code tier is **ui-monospace**, the system mono — preferred over a webfont mono to avoid unnecessary downloads.

The OpenType `ss03` stylistic set is enabled across every role. It alters specific glyph forms (lowercase `a`, `g`, single-story numerals) for a slightly more geometric character. Apply via `font-feature-settings: "ss03"` on the body element or root.

### Principles
- **Display thinness is the brand.** Always render display sizes at weight 330 — never 400+. The thinness is a deliberate editorial choice that makes the giant size feel quiet.
- **Display in NHGD, body in Inter.** Don''t push body roles up to NHGD; don''t push display roles down to Inter.
- **Tracking lifts on display.** The 96px hero gets +2.4px positive tracking — the thin glyphs need air. At 70px and below, tracking returns to 0.

### Note on Font Substitutes
Open substitutes for Neue Haas Grotesk Display: **Helvetica Now Display** (proprietary) or **Inter Display** at light weights (open-source) are the closest matches. Avoid Helvetica Neue at default weight — it''s too heavy for the brand''s thin tier. **Inter Variable** is open-source via Google Fonts and is the canonical body face — no substitute needed.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/shopify/DESIGN.md","category":"typography"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 3),
((select id from d), 'layout', 'Layout', 'layout', '## Layout

### Spacing System
- **Base unit**: 8px (with denser sub-units 1, 2, 3, 4 for fine work).
- **Tokens**: `{spacing.xxs}` 2px · `{spacing.xs}` 4px · `{spacing.sm}` 8px · `{spacing.md}` 12px · `{spacing.lg}` 16px · `{spacing.xl}` 24px · `{spacing.xxl}` 32px · `{spacing.huge}` 64px.
- **Section padding**: `{spacing.huge}` 64–128px on cinematic marketing pages (extreme negative space is the point); collapses to ~48px on transactional pages where density takes priority.
- **Card internal padding**: `{spacing.xxl}` 32px on pricing cards; `{spacing.xl}` 24px on compact tag rows.

### Grid & Container
- Cinematic hero pages use a wide max-width container (~1440–1600px) with edge-bleeding photography that escapes the container.
- Pricing collapses through 4-up → 2-up → 1-up tiers based on viewport.
- Body content centers in a ~720–840px reading column on long-form pages.

### Whitespace Philosophy
The cinematic track treats whitespace as the brand''s most valuable asset — sections often have 128–192px of vertical air between content blocks, with photography filling the rest. The transactional track tightens to ~48–64px between bands because users are scanning, comparing, and acting. The contrast between the two whitespace philosophies is part of the brand voice.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/shopify/DESIGN.md","category":"layout"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 4),

### Decorative Depth
On the cinematic track, depth comes from photography — full-bleed merchant imagery layered behind cards, with subtle inset top-edge highlights creating the illusion of light hitting a glass surface. On the light track, the layered tiny-shadow stack (Level 3) produces a soft, paper-like halo around pricing cards — depth without harshness.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/shopify/DESIGN.md","category":"elevation"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 5),

Photography is full-bleed with no border. On cinematic pages it escapes the container entirely; on transactional pages it sits inside `{rounded.lg}` containers with no shadow.

### Buttons

**`button-primary-pill`** — the dominant CTA across the system.
- Background `{colors.primary}` (black), text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.body-md}`, padding `{spacing.md} {spacing.xl}` (12px 24px), rounded `{rounded.pill}` 9999px.
- Pressed state `button-primary-pill-pressed`: background lifts to `{colors.shade-70}`.

**`button-outline-on-dark`** — the cinematic hero CTA.
- Background `{colors.canvas-night}` (transparent on the canvas), 2px solid `{colors.on-primary}` border, text `{colors.on-primary}`, same pill geometry.

**`button-outline-on-light`** — the light-track equivalent.
- Background `{colors.canvas-light}`, 1px solid `{colors.ink}` border, text `{colors.ink}`, same pill geometry.

**`button-aloe-pill`** — the featured CTA on pricing pages.
- Background `{colors.aloe-10}`, text `{colors.ink}`, same pill geometry. Used for the "Start free trial" tier.

### Cards & Containers

**`card-pricing`** — the standard tier card on the pricing page.
- Background `{colors.canvas-light}`, padding `{spacing.xxl}`, rounded `{rounded.lg}` 12px, 1px `{colors.hairline-light}` border. Title in `{typography.heading-xl}`, price in `{typography.display-md}`, body in `{typography.body-md}`, CTA pinned to the bottom as `button-primary-pill`.

**`card-pricing-featured`** — the highlighted pricing tier.
- Background `{colors.aloe-10}`, otherwise identical to `card-pricing`. The mint fill (rather than a brand-color border) is the brand''s distinctive featured-tier choice.

**`card-feature-cinematic`** — feature card on the cinematic track.
- Background `{colors.canvas-night-elevated}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, rounded `{rounded.lg}`, often with a top-edge inset highlight (Level 1 elevation). Holds full-bleed photography or a single large statement.

**`card-pistachio-band`** — wide horizontal band card used to highlight a category of features on the light track.
- Background `{colors.pistachio-10}`, text `{colors.ink}`, rounded `{rounded.lg}` 12px, padding `{spacing.xxl}`.

**`card-photo-frame`** — full-bleed photography container on cinematic pages.
- Background `{colors.canvas-night}`, padding 0, rounded `{rounded.xl}` 20px (often top-only). The photo IS the content; no inner padding, no overlay text inside the card.

### Inputs & Forms

**`text-input`** — standard text input on light surfaces.
- Background `{colors.canvas-light}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.body-md}`, padding `{spacing.sm}+ {spacing.md}` (10px 12px), rounded `{rounded.md}` 8px, 1px `{colors.hairline-light}` border.

### Navigation

**`nav-bar-light`** — top nav on light pages.
- Background `{colors.canvas-light}`, text `{colors.ink}`, padding `{spacing.lg} {spacing.xl}`. Logo wordmark on the left, nav items center, two pill buttons on the right (`button-outline-on-light` for "Log in", `button-primary-pill` for "Start free trial").

**`nav-bar-dark`** — top nav on cinematic pages.
- Background `{colors.canvas-night}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, otherwise identical structure. Two pill buttons on the right (`button-outline-on-dark` for both, with the rightmost subtly more prominent via type weight).

### Pills, Tags, and Chips

**`pill-tag-mint`** — small tag on light surfaces, signaling a feature category.
- Background `{colors.aloe-10}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.eyebrow-cap}`, padding `{spacing.xs} {spacing.md}`, rounded `{rounded.pill}`.

**`pill-tag-shade`** — neutral tag on light surfaces.
- Background `{colors.shade-30}`, text `{colors.ink}`, otherwise same shape as `pill-tag-mint`.

### Signature Components

**Cinematic Photography Layer** — full-bleed merchant photos on the hero. No overlay scrim, no text-on-image; instead, the type sits in clean negative space above or below the photo. The brand treats photography as an editorial spread, not as decoration.

**Stacked Tiny Shadows (Level 3 Elevation)** — pricing cards on the light track use 4 stacked tiny drop shadows (each 1–8px Y offset, 10% black) to produce a soft, layered paper halo. This is the brand''s distinctive depth on light.

**`link-on-dark`** — inline link on cinematic pages.
- Color `{colors.on-primary}`, no underline by default (links rely on context); for tertiary footer links, color shifts to one of the cool muted tones (`{colors.link-cool-1}` etc.) with a persistent underline.

**`footer-dark`** — full-page-width footer on the cinematic track.
- Background `{colors.canvas-night}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.caption}`, padding `{spacing.huge} {spacing.xl}`. Contains 4–5 columns of muted-tone link groups, social icons, and a small legal row.

**`footer-light`** — equivalent on the transactional track.
- Background `{colors.canvas-light}`, text `{colors.ink}`, otherwise same structure.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/shopify/DESIGN.md","category":"components"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 7),
((select id from d), 'dos_and_donts', 'Do''s and Don''ts', 'dos_and_donts', '## Do''s and Don''ts

### Do
- Reserve `{colors.aloe-10}` and `{colors.pistachio-10}` for the light track only — they don''t appear on cinematic black pages.
- Always use `{rounded.pill}` for buttons; never `{rounded.md}` or `{rounded.lg}`.
- Render display tiers at weight 330; bumping to 400 or 500 breaks the brand''s thin-display signature.
- Use full-bleed photography on cinematic pages — let it escape the container.
- Apply `font-feature-settings: "ss03"` globally; the stylistic set is the brand''s typographic signature.
- Pair black canvas with white type and white-stroked outline pills; pair light canvas with black type and filled-black pills.

### Don''t
- Don''t introduce a third canvas color — stick to black or light/cream. Greys, beiges, and blues are not in the system.
- Don''t add drop shadows on cinematic dark cards beyond the subtle inset top-highlight; the cinematic track wants flat blackness.
- Don''t shrink display tiers below `{typography.display-md}` (48px) on hero surfaces; below that they read as section heads, not display.
- Don''t put aloe / pistachio greens behind type — they''re surface fills, not text colors.
- Don''t replace the pill shape with a rounded-rectangle button anywhere.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/shopify/DESIGN.md","category":"dos_and_donts"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 8),

### Breakpoints

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Wide | ≥ 1440px | Full cinematic hero with edge-bleeding photography; pricing 4-up |
| Desktop | 1024–1440px | Default content max-width; pricing 4-up tightens |
| Tablet | 768–1023px | Pricing 2-up; cinematic hero photography crops |
| Mobile | < 768px | Pricing 1-up; hamburger nav; display-xxl drops to ~56–64px |

### Touch Targets
- Pill buttons hit ≥ 44×44px on mobile via 12px vertical padding × 16px line-height. WCAG AAA compliant.
- Form fields stay at the 44px minimum height across all breakpoints.

### Collapsing Strategy
- Display sizes scale down through the breakpoint stair: 96 → 70 → 55 → 48 → 36px on mobile.
- Cinematic photography crops aggressively at smaller widths, prioritizing focal subject over edge-bleed.
- Pricing tiers stair-step 4-up → 2-up → 1-up; the featured aloe tier stays visually distinguished at every step.
- Top nav collapses to hamburger below 768px; menu inherits canvas polarity.

## Overview

Slacc''s design language centers on a deep aubergine primary (`{colors.primary}`) — the brand''s most enduring visual asset — applied as the dominant button color, the footer band, the featured pricing tier, and the brand wordmark. Around that aubergine the system stages an unusually delicate ecosystem: cream-lavender hero canvases with soft pastel-mesh gradients (peachy oranges, lavenders, dusty greens) that pulse behind floating product UI mockups, with the actual interface chrome rendered in fine detail at 3:2 aspect.

Typography splits between two proprietary humanist sans families. The display tier runs at 700 weight at sizes 32–64px with negative letter-spacing for tight optical density on hero headlines. The UI tier uses the second family at 400–700 with slightly relaxed leading (1.55) — the brand''s body copy reads quietly without competing with the aubergine moments.

Buttons are pill-shaped at 90px radius with an unusual amount of horizontal padding (28–30px), giving them a distinctly comfortable, almost over-padded feel. The primary aubergine pill is the only filled button in most contexts; secondary actions use a soft lavender pill (`{colors.canvas-lavender}`) which reads as a gentler echo of the primary surface. Inline links shift to a saturated blue (`{colors.link-blue}`) — the brand''s only chromatic departure from the aubergine-and-cream world.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Single aubergine primary (`{colors.primary}`) reused across CTAs, the featured pricing tier, the footer band, and the wordmark — the brand''s chromatic monotheism.
- Cream-lavender hero canvas (`{colors.canvas-cream}` / `{colors.canvas-lavender}`) with diffused pastel-mesh atmospheric gradients and floating UI mockups composited above.
- Pill buttons at `{rounded.pill}` (90px radius) with generous 28–30px horizontal padding — over-padded by SaaS-default standards, deliberately so.
- Tight negative letter-spacing on display sizes (-0.768px on 64px hero) for editorial-density headlines.
- Blue inline links (`{colors.link-blue}`) — the only non-aubergine chromatic accent in body type.
- Pastel-mesh gradient atmospherics: every hero band has a subtle peach-lavender-dusty-green wash behind it; product UI sits on top, never inside, the gradient.
- Statistics cards rendered in massive aubergine display type (90% / 43 / 87%) on white — quantitative emphasis through scale alone.

## Colors

> **Source pages:** home (`/`), `/features/channels`, `/pricing`, `/contact-sales`.

### Brand & Accent
- **Aubergine** (`{colors.primary}` — `#4a154b`): The brand''s primary surface and CTA color. Deep, warm purple with a hint of ruby — used on filled buttons, the featured pricing tier, the footer band, and the brand wordmark.
- **Aubergine Deep** (`{colors.primary-deep}` — `#481a54`): A near-identical sibling of `{colors.primary}` extracted from a different surface; treat as functionally equivalent.
- **Aubergine Press** (`{colors.primary-press}` — `#611f69`): Pressed-state lift of the primary, slightly lighter and warmer.
- **Aubergine Tint** (`{colors.primary-tint}` — `#592466`): Border accent on aubergine-on-aubergine surfaces.
- **Link Blue** (`{colors.link-blue}` — `#1264a3`): Inline link color — saturated, slightly warm blue. The only chromatic alternative to aubergine in body type.
- **Link Hover** (`{colors.link-hover}` — `#3860be`): A more saturated blue used on link hover state.

### Surface
- **Canvas White** (`{colors.canvas}` — `#ffffff`): Default content surface.
- **Canvas Cream** (`{colors.canvas-cream}` — `#f4ede4`): Warm off-white used on hero gradients and feature bands. Adds editorial warmth.
- **Canvas Lavender** (`{colors.canvas-lavender}` — `#f9f0ff`): Pale lavender tint used as the secondary-button surface and as a soft section band.
- **Surface Aubergine** (`{colors.surface-aubergine}` — `#4a154b`): The primary aubergine reused as a surface — featured pricing tier, footer, dark feature bands.
- **Hairline** (`{colors.hairline}` — `#e6e6e6`): 1px borders on cards and table dividers.

### Text
- **Ink** (`{colors.ink}` — `#1d1d1d`): Primary body text on light surfaces. Just shy of pure black.
- **Ink Mute** (`{colors.ink-mute}` — `#696969`): Secondary text, captions, helper copy.
- **On Primary** (`{colors.on-primary}` — `#ffffff`): Text on aubergine surfaces and filled CTAs.
- **On Aubergine Mute** (`{colors.on-aubergine-mute}` — `#d9bdde`): Secondary text on aubergine surfaces — a desaturated mauve that reads as muted-light.

### Semantic
- **Error** (`{colors.semantic-error}` — `#cc4117`): Form error and destructive-action color.
- **Success** (`{colors.semantic-success}` — `#007a5a`): Inline success indicators.

## Typography

### Font Family

The display tier is **Salesforce Avant Garde** — a proprietary humanist sans with broad apertures and a slightly geometric character. When unavailable, fall back to the system font stack (`system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont`).

The UI tier is **Salesforce Sans** — a separate proprietary face used for body, captions, and button labels. Same fallback chain.

Both faces are proprietary and not freely available. Substitute with **Inter** (open-source via Google Fonts) at matching weights for both display and body — Inter is the closest open analogue across both tiers.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-xxl}` | 64px | 700 | 1.12 | -0.768px | Marketing hero headline |
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 58px | 600 | 1.25 | -0.464px | Section openers |
| `{typography.display-lg}` | 50px | 700 | 1.12 | -0.6px | Statistics callouts |
| `{typography.display-md}` | 32px | 700 | 1.25 | -0.256px | Card / feature titles |
| `{typography.heading-lg}` | 24px | 700 | 1.33 | -0.096px | Pricing tier names |
| `{typography.heading-md}` | 22px | 600 | 1.4 | 0 | Sub-section heading |
| `{typography.heading-sm}` | 18px | 600 | 1.56 | -0.0216px | Compact card title |
| `{typography.body-lg}` | 18px | 400 | 1.55 | -0.0216px | Marketing body lead |
| `{typography.body-md}` | 16px | 400 | 1.55 | 0 | Default UI body |
| `{typography.body-strong}` | 16px | 700 | 1.5 | 0.16px | Emphasized body |
| `{typography.button-lg}` | 18px | 700 | 1.0 | 0 | Hero pill button label |
| `{typography.button-md}` | 16px | 700 | 1.38 | 0.2px | Standard pill button label |
| `{typography.button-cap}` | 14.4px | 700 | 1.0 | 0.144px | Compact pill label |
| `{typography.caption}` | 14px | 400 | 1.43 | 0.1px | Helper, footnote |
| `{typography.micro-cap}` | 12px | 700 | 1.0 | 0.96px | All-caps eyebrow |

### Principles
- **Tight tracking on display.** Negative letter-spacing across 32–64px sizes; the proprietary face is wide by default, the negative tracking pulls it into editorial density.
- **Body at 1.55 leading.** Slightly relaxed for marketing readability without crossing into airy / 1.7+ territory.
- **Caps for eyebrows.** All eyebrows render uppercase with positive 0.96–0.144px tracking depending on size.

### Note on Font Substitutes
Use **Inter** (open-source Google Fonts) for both display and UI tiers — Inter at 700 weight with `-0.768px` letter-spacing closely approximates the brand''s display behavior. For maximum brand fidelity, **Lato** is a softer humanist alternative that pairs well at body sizes. Avoid System UI fonts on the body — the brand''s subtle warmth disappears at default weights.

## Layout

### Spacing System
- **Base unit**: 8px (with 4 / 12 / 16 / 20 / 24 / 28 sub-tokens for fine vertical rhythm).
- **Tokens**: `{spacing.xs}` 4px · `{spacing.sm}` 8px · `{spacing.md}` 12px · `{spacing.lg}` 16px · `{spacing.xl}` 20px · `{spacing.xxl}` 24px · `{spacing.huge}` 28px.
- **Section padding**: 64–96px on marketing surfaces; tightens to 48px on transactional pages.
- **Card internal padding**: 32px on pricing cards; 48px on aubergine band cards.

### Grid & Container
- Marketing pages center in a ~1240px container with edge-bleeding pastel-mesh gradients escaping the container.
- Pricing collapses 4-up → 2-up → 1-up at 992 / 768 breakpoints.
- Statistics row: 3-column grid with massive 50px aubergine display numerals.

### Whitespace Philosophy
The pastel-mesh gradients fill most of the negative space on marketing pages — sections feel expansive without being literally empty. On transactional pages the gradients drop, and whitespace reverts to traditional 48px-section breathing room.

## Elevation & Depth

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Flat | Default surface |
| 1 | `box-shadow: rgba(0,0,0,0.1) 0 5px 20px 0` | Floating buttons on hero |
| 2 | `box-shadow: rgba(0,0,0,0.1) 0 0 32px 0` | Product UI mockup composites |
| 3 | `box-shadow: rgba(0,0,0,0.2) 0 1px 10px 0` | Toast / notification chrome |
| 4 | `box-shadow: rgb(97,31,105) 0 0 0 1px inset` | Aubergine inset border (button focus, special chrome) |

### Decorative Depth
The brand''s depth language is the **pastel-mesh gradient** — peach, lavender, dusty green stops blurred together at large radii to create soft atmospheric backdrops behind product UI screenshots. The gradient is the brand''s flavor of "depth without shadows": the eye perceives the product mockup as floating above a luminous backdrop without any literal lift.

## Shapes

### Border Radius Scale

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{rounded.xs}` | 2px | Hairline tags, status pills (rare) |
| `{rounded.sm}` | 4px | Form inputs |
| `{rounded.md}` | 8px | Compact card chrome, video frames |
| `{rounded.lg}` | 12px | Mid-size cards, secondary surface |
| `{rounded.xl}` | 16px | Pricing cards, feature cards |
| `{rounded.xxl}` | 48px | Stat badge backdrops |
| `{rounded.pill}` | 90px | All buttons |

### Photography Geometry
The brand uses **product UI screenshots** more than photography. UI mockups sit on top of pastel-mesh gradients at roughly 4:3 aspect, with no shadow but with the gradient providing the "lift" the eye expects. Real photography appears in customer-logo strips and the occasional case-study card, treated as full-bleed inside `{rounded.xl}` containers.

## Components

### Buttons

**`button-primary-pill`** — the dominant CTA system-wide.
- Background `{colors.primary}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.button-md}`, padding `14px 28px`, rounded `{rounded.pill}` 90px.
- Pressed state `button-primary-pill-pressed` shifts background to `{colors.primary-press}`.

**`button-secondary-pill`** — the soft lavender alternative.
- Background `{colors.canvas-lavender}`, text `{colors.ink}`, padding `10px 30px`, same pill geometry. Used as the second action beside the primary aubergine pill.

**`button-outline-aubergine`** — outline variant on white surfaces.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.primary}`, 2px solid `{colors.primary}` border, same pill shape.

**`button-outline-on-aubergine`** — outline on aubergine canvas.
- Background `{colors.surface-aubergine}` (transparent over the surface), text `{colors.on-primary}`, 2px solid `{colors.on-primary}` border, same pill shape.

### Cards & Containers

**`card-pricing`** — standard pricing tier card.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, padding `{spacing.xxl}+` (32px), rounded `{rounded.xl}` 16px, 1px `{colors.hairline}` border. Title in `{typography.heading-lg}`, price in `{typography.display-md}`, body in `{typography.body-md}`, CTA pinned to bottom as `button-primary-pill`.

**`card-pricing-featured`** — the inverted aubergine featured tier.
- Background `{colors.surface-aubergine}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, otherwise identical to `card-pricing`. The aubergine fill is the brand''s signature featured-tier choice.

**`card-feature-cream`** — feature explanation card on the cream track.
- Background `{colors.canvas-cream}`, text `{colors.ink}`, rounded `{rounded.xl}`, padding 32px.

**`card-aubergine-band`** — large horizontal band card with aubergine fill, often containing the closing CTA of a marketing page.
- Background `{colors.surface-aubergine}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, padding 48px, rounded `{rounded.xl}` 16px.

**`card-stat`** — statistics callout card.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.primary}` rendered in `{typography.display-lg}` (50px aubergine numeral). Holds a single percentage/number with a small caption underneath.

### Inputs & Forms

**`text-input`** — standard form field.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.body-md}`, padding `10px 12px`, rounded `{rounded.sm}` 4px, 1px `{colors.hairline}` border.

### Navigation

**`nav-bar-light`** — top nav across all marketing pages.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, padding `{spacing.lg} {spacing.xxl}`. Logo wordmark on the left, nav items center, two pill buttons on the right (`button-secondary-pill` for "Sign In", `button-primary-pill` for "Try For Free").

### Pills, Tags, and Chips

**`pill-cap-shade`** — small all-caps pill used as eyebrow above pricing-tier titles.
- Background `{colors.canvas-cream}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.micro-cap}`, padding `4px 12px`, rounded `{rounded.pill}`.

### Signature Components

**Pastel-Mesh Gradient Backdrop** — peach (`#fff0e6`-ish) + lavender (`#e9d8ff`) + dusty green stops blurred together behind hero bands. Implemented as a CSS radial-gradient stack, not a single image. Provides the brand''s depth/luminosity without literal shadows.

**Floating Product UI Mockup** — product screenshots framed in `{rounded.lg}` (12px) containers, positioned above the pastel-mesh gradient with no border or shadow. The gradient does the lifting.

**Aubergine Footer Band** — every marketing page closes with a full-bleed `card-aubergine-band` containing a closing CTA in white type. The band height is generous (~480–600px on desktop) and reads as the page''s signature.

**`link-on-light`** — inline links in body copy on light surfaces.
- Text `{colors.link-blue}` rendered in `{typography.body-md}`. No underline by default; underline appears on hover via the link-hover behavior.

**`link-on-aubergine`** — links inside aubergine surfaces.
- Text `{colors.on-primary}` with persistent underline.

**`footer-aubergine`** — site-wide footer.
- Background `{colors.surface-aubergine}`, text `{colors.on-primary}` rendered in `{typography.caption}`, padding `{spacing.huge}+ {spacing.xxl}` (32px 24px). Holds 4–5 columns of `{colors.on-aubergine-mute}` link groups, social icons, and a small legal/copyright row at the bottom.

## Do''s and Don''ts

### Do
- Reserve `{colors.primary}` aubergine for filled CTAs, the featured pricing tier, and the closing aubergine band — it''s the brand''s chromatic monotheism.
- Use `{rounded.pill}` (90px) for every button across the system — never a rounded-rectangle button.
- Pair display tiers with negative letter-spacing (`-0.768px` at 64px); the proprietary face needs the tracking pull.
- Compose hero bands with pastel-mesh gradient backdrop + floating product UI mockup; the gradient is the depth.
- Use `{colors.link-blue}` for inline links — it''s the only chromatic departure from aubergine and is part of the brand voice.

### Don''t
- Don''t add a third accent color to the system — the aubergine + blue link combination is exhaustive.
- Don''t shrink button padding below `14px 28px` — the over-padded pill is part of the brand feel.
- Don''t render display tiers at default tracking (0) — without negative letter-spacing the headlines read loose and unedited.
- Don''t put product UI screenshots inside cards — they sit ABOVE the pastel-mesh gradient, never inside chrome.
- Don''t use aubergine for body text — it''s a surface and CTA color, not a type color at body sizes.
- Don''t replace the pill shape with a square button anywhere.

## Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Wide | ≥ 1440px | Full-bleed pastel-mesh hero; pricing 4-up |
| Desktop | 1024–1440px | Default content max-width; pricing 4-up |
| Tablet | 768–1023px | Pricing 2-up; product UI mockups crop to focal panel |
| Mobile | < 768px | Pricing 1-up; hamburger nav; display-xxl drops 64 → 40px |

### Touch Targets
- Pill buttons hit ≥ 48×48px due to the over-padded geometry. WCAG AAA compliant.
- Form fields stay at the 44px minimum height.

### Collapsing Strategy
- Display tiers stair-step 64 → 50 → 32 → 28 → 24 across breakpoints.
- Pastel-mesh gradients re-tile on mobile to prevent the wash from disappearing entirely.
- Floating product UI mockups crop to the most actionable inner panel on mobile.
- Pricing tiers stair-step 4 → 2 → 1; aubergine featured tier stays distinguished.
- Top nav collapses to hamburger below 768px; menu inherits canvas color.

### Image Behavior
Product UI mockups use `srcset` for desktop / tablet / mobile crops; the mobile crop centers on the most actionable inner panel rather than scaling the whole composite down.

## Iteration Guide

1. Focus on ONE component at a time.
2. Reference component names and tokens directly (`{colors.primary}`, `{button-primary-pill}-pressed`, `{rounded.pill}`).
3. Run `npx @google/design.md lint DESIGN.md` after edits.
4. Add new variants as separate entries.
5. Default body to `{typography.body-md}`; reserve `{typography.body-lg}` for marketing leads.
6. Keep aubergine scarce — one filled aubergine button per viewport.
7. Pair every hero band with the pastel-mesh gradient backdrop; bare-canvas heroes read as off-brand.

- **Link Blue** (`{colors.link-blue}` — `#1264a3`): Inline link color — saturated, slightly warm blue. The only chromatic alternative to aubergine in body type.
- **Link Hover** (`{colors.link-hover}` — `#3860be`): A more saturated blue used on link hover state.

### Surface
- **Canvas White** (`{colors.canvas}` — `#ffffff`): Default content surface.
- **Canvas Cream** (`{colors.canvas-cream}` — `#f4ede4`): Warm off-white used on hero gradients and feature bands. Adds editorial warmth.
- **Canvas Lavender** (`{colors.canvas-lavender}` — `#f9f0ff`): Pale lavender tint used as the secondary-button surface and as a soft section band.
- **Surface Aubergine** (`{colors.surface-aubergine}` — `#4a154b`): The primary aubergine reused as a surface — featured pricing tier, footer, dark feature bands.
- **Hairline** (`{colors.hairline}` — `#e6e6e6`): 1px borders on cards and table dividers.

### Text
- **Ink** (`{colors.ink}` — `#1d1d1d`): Primary body text on light surfaces. Just shy of pure black.
- **Ink Mute** (`{colors.ink-mute}` — `#696969`): Secondary text, captions, helper copy.
- **On Primary** (`{colors.on-primary}` — `#ffffff`): Text on aubergine surfaces and filled CTAs.
- **On Aubergine Mute** (`{colors.on-aubergine-mute}` — `#d9bdde`): Secondary text on aubergine surfaces — a desaturated mauve that reads as muted-light.

### Semantic
- **Error** (`{colors.semantic-error}` — `#cc4117`): Form error and destructive-action color.
- **Success** (`{colors.semantic-success}` — `#007a5a`): Inline success indicators.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/slack/DESIGN.md","category":"colors"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 2),

### Font Family

The display tier is **Salesforce Avant Garde** — a proprietary humanist sans with broad apertures and a slightly geometric character. When unavailable, fall back to the system font stack (`system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont`).

The UI tier is **Salesforce Sans** — a separate proprietary face used for body, captions, and button labels. Same fallback chain.

Both faces are proprietary and not freely available. Substitute with **Inter** (open-source via Google Fonts) at matching weights for both display and body — Inter is the closest open analogue across both tiers.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-xxl}` | 64px | 700 | 1.12 | -0.768px | Marketing hero headline |
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 58px | 600 | 1.25 | -0.464px | Section openers |
| `{typography.display-lg}` | 50px | 700 | 1.12 | -0.6px | Statistics callouts |
| `{typography.display-md}` | 32px | 700 | 1.25 | -0.256px | Card / feature titles |

| `{typography.body-lg}` | 18px | 400 | 1.55 | -0.0216px | Marketing body lead |
| `{typography.body-md}` | 16px | 400 | 1.55 | 0 | Default UI body |

| `{typography.micro-cap}` | 12px | 700 | 1.0 | 0.96px | All-caps eyebrow |

### Principles
- **Tight tracking on display.** Negative letter-spacing across 32–64px sizes; the proprietary face is wide by default, the negative tracking pulls it into editorial density.
- **Body at 1.55 leading.** Slightly relaxed for marketing readability without crossing into airy / 1.7+ territory.
- **Caps for eyebrows.** All eyebrows render uppercase with positive 0.96–0.144px tracking depending on size.

### Note on Font Substitutes
Use **Inter** (open-source Google Fonts) for both display and UI tiers — Inter at 700 weight with `-0.768px` letter-spacing closely approximates the brand''s display behavior. For maximum brand fidelity, **Lato** is a softer humanist alternative that pairs well at body sizes. Avoid System UI fonts on the body — the brand''s subtle warmth disappears at default weights.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/slack/DESIGN.md","category":"typography"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 3),

### Spacing System
- **Base unit**: 8px (with 4 / 12 / 16 / 20 / 24 / 28 sub-tokens for fine vertical rhythm).
- **Tokens**: `{spacing.xs}` 4px · `{spacing.sm}` 8px · `{spacing.md}` 12px · `{spacing.lg}` 16px · `{spacing.xl}` 20px · `{spacing.xxl}` 24px · `{spacing.huge}` 28px.
- **Section padding**: 64–96px on marketing surfaces; tightens to 48px on transactional pages.
- **Card internal padding**: 32px on pricing cards; 48px on aubergine band cards.

### Grid & Container
- Marketing pages center in a ~1240px container with edge-bleeding pastel-mesh gradients escaping the container.
- Pricing collapses 4-up → 2-up → 1-up at 992 / 768 breakpoints.
- Statistics row: 3-column grid with massive 50px aubergine display numerals.

### Whitespace Philosophy
The pastel-mesh gradients fill most of the negative space on marketing pages — sections feel expansive without being literally empty. On transactional pages the gradients drop, and whitespace reverts to traditional 48px-section breathing room.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/slack/DESIGN.md","category":"layout"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 4),

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Flat | Default surface |
| 1 | `box-shadow: rgba(0,0,0,0.1) 0 5px 20px 0` | Floating buttons on hero |

| 4 | `box-shadow: rgb(97,31,105) 0 0 0 1px inset` | Aubergine inset border (button focus, special chrome) |

### Decorative Depth
The brand''s depth language is the **pastel-mesh gradient** — peach, lavender, dusty green stops blurred together at large radii to create soft atmospheric backdrops behind product UI screenshots. The gradient is the brand''s flavor of "depth without shadows": the eye perceives the product mockup as floating above a luminous backdrop without any literal lift.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/slack/DESIGN.md","category":"elevation"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 5),

### Border Radius Scale

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{rounded.xs}` | 2px | Hairline tags, status pills (rare) |
| `{rounded.sm}` | 4px | Form inputs |
| `{rounded.md}` | 8px | Compact card chrome, video frames |

| `{rounded.xl}` | 16px | Pricing cards, feature cards |
| `{rounded.xxl}` | 48px | Stat badge backdrops |
| `{rounded.pill}` | 90px | All buttons |

### Photography Geometry
The brand uses **product UI screenshots** more than photography. UI mockups sit on top of pastel-mesh gradients at roughly 4:3 aspect, with no shadow but with the gradient providing the "lift" the eye expects. Real photography appears in customer-logo strips and the occasional case-study card, treated as full-bleed inside `{rounded.xl}` containers.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/slack/DESIGN.md","category":"shapes"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 6),
((select id from d), 'components', 'Components', 'components', '## Components

### Buttons

**`button-primary-pill`** — the dominant CTA system-wide.
- Background `{colors.primary}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.button-md}`, padding `14px 28px`, rounded `{rounded.pill}` 90px.
- Pressed state `button-primary-pill-pressed` shifts background to `{colors.primary-press}`.

**`button-secondary-pill`** — the soft lavender alternative.
- Background `{colors.canvas-lavender}`, text `{colors.ink}`, padding `10px 30px`, same pill geometry. Used as the second action beside the primary aubergine pill.

**`button-outline-aubergine`** — outline variant on white surfaces.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.primary}`, 2px solid `{colors.primary}` border, same pill shape.

**`button-outline-on-aubergine`** — outline on aubergine canvas.
- Background `{colors.surface-aubergine}` (transparent over the surface), text `{colors.on-primary}`, 2px solid `{colors.on-primary}` border, same pill shape.

### Cards & Containers

**`card-pricing`** — standard pricing tier card.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, padding `{spacing.xxl}+` (32px), rounded `{rounded.xl}` 16px, 1px `{colors.hairline}` border. Title in `{typography.heading-lg}`, price in `{typography.display-md}`, body in `{typography.body-md}`, CTA pinned to bottom as `button-primary-pill`.

**`card-pricing-featured`** — the inverted aubergine featured tier.
- Background `{colors.surface-aubergine}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, otherwise identical to `card-pricing`. The aubergine fill is the brand''s signature featured-tier choice.

**`card-feature-cream`** — feature explanation card on the cream track.
- Background `{colors.canvas-cream}`, text `{colors.ink}`, rounded `{rounded.xl}`, padding 32px.

**`card-aubergine-band`** — large horizontal band card with aubergine fill, often containing the closing CTA of a marketing page.
- Background `{colors.surface-aubergine}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, padding 48px, rounded `{rounded.xl}` 16px.

**`card-stat`** — statistics callout card.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.primary}` rendered in `{typography.display-lg}` (50px aubergine numeral). Holds a single percentage/number with a small caption underneath.

### Inputs & Forms

**`text-input`** — standard form field.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.body-md}`, padding `10px 12px`, rounded `{rounded.sm}` 4px, 1px `{colors.hairline}` border.

### Navigation

**`nav-bar-light`** — top nav across all marketing pages.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, padding `{spacing.lg} {spacing.xxl}`. Logo wordmark on the left, nav items center, two pill buttons on the right (`button-secondary-pill` for "Sign In", `button-primary-pill` for "Try For Free").

### Pills, Tags, and Chips

**`pill-cap-shade`** — small all-caps pill used as eyebrow above pricing-tier titles.
- Background `{colors.canvas-cream}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.micro-cap}`, padding `4px 12px`, rounded `{rounded.pill}`.

### Signature Components

**Pastel-Mesh Gradient Backdrop** — peach (`#fff0e6`-ish) + lavender (`#e9d8ff`) + dusty green stops blurred together behind hero bands. Implemented as a CSS radial-gradient stack, not a single image. Provides the brand''s depth/luminosity without literal shadows.

**Floating Product UI Mockup** — product screenshots framed in `{rounded.lg}` (12px) containers, positioned above the pastel-mesh gradient with no border or shadow. The gradient does the lifting.

**Aubergine Footer Band** — every marketing page closes with a full-bleed `card-aubergine-band` containing a closing CTA in white type. The band height is generous (~480–600px on desktop) and reads as the page''s signature.

**`link-on-light`** — inline links in body copy on light surfaces.
- Text `{colors.link-blue}` rendered in `{typography.body-md}`. No underline by default; underline appears on hover via the link-hover behavior.

**`link-on-aubergine`** — links inside aubergine surfaces.
- Text `{colors.on-primary}` with persistent underline.

**`footer-aubergine`** — site-wide footer.
- Background `{colors.surface-aubergine}`, text `{colors.on-primary}` rendered in `{typography.caption}`, padding `{spacing.huge}+ {spacing.xxl}` (32px 24px). Holds 4–5 columns of `{colors.on-aubergine-mute}` link groups, social icons, and a small legal/copyright row at the bottom.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/slack/DESIGN.md","category":"components"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 7),
((select id from d), 'dos_and_donts', 'Do''s and Don''ts', 'dos_and_donts', '## Do''s and Don''ts

### Do
- Reserve `{colors.primary}` aubergine for filled CTAs, the featured pricing tier, and the closing aubergine band — it''s the brand''s chromatic monotheism.
- Use `{rounded.pill}` (90px) for every button across the system — never a rounded-rectangle button.
- Pair display tiers with negative letter-spacing (`-0.768px` at 64px); the proprietary face needs the tracking pull.
- Compose hero bands with pastel-mesh gradient backdrop + floating product UI mockup; the gradient is the depth.
- Use `{colors.link-blue}` for inline links — it''s the only chromatic departure from aubergine and is part of the brand voice.

### Don''t
- Don''t add a third accent color to the system — the aubergine + blue link combination is exhaustive.
- Don''t shrink button padding below `14px 28px` — the over-padded pill is part of the brand feel.
- Don''t render display tiers at default tracking (0) — without negative letter-spacing the headlines read loose and unedited.
- Don''t put product UI screenshots inside cards — they sit ABOVE the pastel-mesh gradient, never inside chrome.
- Don''t use aubergine for body text — it''s a surface and CTA color, not a type color at body sizes.
- Don''t replace the pill shape with a square button anywhere.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/slack/DESIGN.md","category":"dos_and_donts"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 8),

### Breakpoints

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Wide | ≥ 1440px | Full-bleed pastel-mesh hero; pricing 4-up |
| Desktop | 1024–1440px | Default content max-width; pricing 4-up |
| Tablet | 768–1023px | Pricing 2-up; product UI mockups crop to focal panel |
| Mobile | < 768px | Pricing 1-up; hamburger nav; display-xxl drops 64 → 40px |

### Touch Targets
- Pill buttons hit ≥ 48×48px due to the over-padded geometry. WCAG AAA compliant.
- Form fields stay at the 44px minimum height.

### Collapsing Strategy
- Display tiers stair-step 64 → 50 → 32 → 28 → 24 across breakpoints.
- Pastel-mesh gradients re-tile on mobile to prevent the wash from disappearing entirely.
- Floating product UI mockups crop to the most actionable inner panel on mobile.
- Pricing tiers stair-step 4 → 2 → 1; aubergine featured tier stays distinguished.
- Top nav collapses to hamburger below 768px; menu inherits canvas color.

### Image Behavior
Product UI mockups use `srcset` for desktop / tablet / mobile crops; the mobile crop centers on the most actionable inner panel rather than scaling the whole composite down.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/slack/DESIGN.md","category":"responsive_guidelines"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 9),

## Overview

Spasex''s design language is an exercise in negation: pure black canvas, white display type set in tight vertical leading and uppercase, full-bleed photography or autoplaying rocket-launch video as the only chrome. There is no brand color beyond black-and-white; there are no decorative shapes; there are no card grids or pricing tables on the marketing pages. Every band is a single full-viewport photograph or video paired with one all-caps headline at `{typography.display-xxl}` (80px D-DIN-Bold) and one ghost-outlined pill CTA. The composition is closer to a film title card than a SaaS landing page.

The brand''s depth is photographic. Mars landscapes, rocket exhaust plumes, the F9 booster on a launchpad at sunset — these are the design system. Type sits over them at high opacity with no scrim, no gradient overlay; the photographs are graded so the type lands cleanly. When type does need a background, it sits on `{colors.canvas-night-soft}` (a barely-lifted near-black) with a 1px hairline in `{colors.hairline-on-dark}`.

Typography splits between **D-DIN-Bold** for display tiers (uppercase, tight tracking, condensed feel) and **D-DIN** regular for body and button labels. There is no third family — even pricing on the shop site uses the same two cuts. The display sizes are unusually tight in vertical leading (0.95–1.25) and unusually loose in horizontal tracking (1.6px positive at 80px) — the brand feels engineered rather than designed.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Single canvas: pure `{colors.canvas-night}` (`#000000`) for marketing; `{colors.canvas-light}` only on the shop site.
- Display tier in uppercase D-DIN-Bold with positive horizontal tracking (1.6px at 80px) — the brand''s typographic signature.
- Full-bleed photography or autoplaying video as the dominant decorative element; type sits directly on imagery with no scrim.
- Single ghost-outlined pill CTA per band, at `{rounded.pill}` 32px radius — never filled, never accent-colored.
- All-caps eyebrow microtext (`{typography.micro-cap}` and `{typography.button-cap}`) with positive 0.96–1.17px tracking — every chrome element shouts in caps.
- Fixed top nav overlaid on photography — no opaque background, just white-on-image.
- Tight 0.95 line-height on the 80px display — vertical compression is the engineering aesthetic.

## Colors

> **Source pages:** home (`/`), `/shop`, `/vehicles/starship`, `/humanspaceflight/overview`, `/mission`.

### Brand & Accent
The brand has no accent colors. Black and white do all the chromatic work; photography supplies every other hue.

### Surface
- **Canvas Night** (`{colors.canvas-night}` — `#000000`): Default marketing canvas. Pure black, no tint.
- **Canvas Night Soft** (`{colors.canvas-night-soft}` — `#0a0a0a`): Barely-lifted near-black for content sections that need a subtle separation from the pure-black hero.
- **Canvas Light** (`{colors.canvas-light}` — `#ffffff`): The shop site''s product surface.
- **Canvas Cool** (`{colors.canvas-cool}` — `#f0f0fa`): A pale cool-blue-white used as the secondary surface on the shop site and as the hover-canvas of certain ghost buttons.
- **Hairline on Dark** (`{colors.hairline-on-dark}` — `#3a3a3f`): 1px borders on dark surface chrome.
- **Hairline on Light** (`{colors.hairline-on-light}` — `#e0e0e8`): Borders on shop-site cards.

### Text
- **On Primary** (`{colors.on-primary}` — `#ffffff`): Default text on dark canvas; the dominant text color across the marketing site.
- **On Primary Mute** (`{colors.on-primary-mute}` — `#f0f0fa`): Slightly cooled-white used for secondary text on dark surfaces — barely distinguishable from `{colors.on-primary}` but enough to suggest a hierarchy.
- **Ink** (`{colors.ink}` — `#000000`): Default text on light surfaces (shop site).
- **Ink Mute** (`{colors.ink-mute}` — `#5a5a5f`): Secondary text on light surfaces.

### Link
- **Link on Dark** (`{colors.link-on-dark}` — `#ffffff`): Underlined inline link on dark canvas.
- **Link Blue Fallback** (`{colors.link-blue-fallback}` — `#0000ee`): The browser default that appears in unstyled fallback contexts — documented for completeness, not used as a brand color.

## Typography

### Font Family

The display tier is **D-DIN-Bold** — a condensed industrial sans inspired by the German DIN 1451 standard (used on autobahn road signage and engineering blueprints). When unavailable, fall back to **Arial Narrow**, then Arial, then Verdana — the fallback chain prioritizes width compression over ornament.

The UI tier is **D-DIN** (regular weight) — the same family at standard width — used for body, button labels, and captions.

D-DIN is freely available from the **DIN Type Foundry** (and a free version under the same name is widely distributed). For maximum brand fidelity, use D-DIN directly; as a substitute, **Inter** at heavy weights (700+) with letter-spacing of 1.6px positive tracking approximates the rhythm. Avoid serif or humanist sans alternatives.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-xxl}` | 80px | 700 | 0.95 | 1.6px | Hero headline (uppercase) |
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 60px | 700 | 1.2 | 1.2px | Section opener (uppercase) |
| `{typography.display-lg}` | 48px | 700 | 1.25 | 0.96px | Sub-section heading (uppercase) |
| `{typography.body-lg}` | 16px | 400 | 1.7 | 0.32px | Marketing body lead |
| `{typography.body-md}` | 16px | 400 | 1.5 | 0.32px | Default UI body |
| `{typography.button-cap}` | 13.008px | 700 | 0.94 | 1.17px | All-caps button label |
| `{typography.micro-cap}` | 12px | 400 | 2.0 | 0.96px | All-caps eyebrow / nav item |
| `{typography.caption}` | 13.008px | 400 | 1.5 | 0 | Helper / footer text |

### Principles
- **Uppercase across display.** Every display tier renders in uppercase. The brand never uses sentence-case display headlines.
- **Tight vertical leading on display.** 0.95 at 80px and 1.2 at 60px — the type stacks engineer-tight.
- **Wide horizontal tracking.** Positive 0.96–1.6px tracking on display sizes; positive 0.96–1.17px on caps eyebrows. The wide tracking is the brand''s signature optical air.
- **No mono.** Code blocks are not part of the brand''s typographic system.

### Note on Font Substitutes
**D-DIN** is freely available (the original DIN-style face under that name is widely distributed). When unavailable, use **Inter** at 700 weight with `letter-spacing: 1.6px`, `text-transform: uppercase`, and `line-height: 0.95` for display sizes — this matches the rhythm. Avoid Helvetica or Arial at default weights — the brand needs the condensed industrial cut. Avoid serif fallbacks entirely.

## Layout

### Spacing System
- **Base unit**: 8px (with denser sub-units 4 / 12 / 16 / 18 / 24).
- **Tokens**: `{spacing.xxs}` 4px · `{spacing.xs}` 8px · `{spacing.sm}` 12px · `{spacing.md}` 16px · `{spacing.lg}` 18px · `{spacing.xl}` 24px · `{spacing.xxl}` 32px · `{spacing.huge}` 48px.
- **Section padding**: full-viewport bands on marketing — no internal padding above/below; the photograph IS the section. On the shop site, sections use 48–64px vertical padding.

### Grid & Container
- Marketing pages have no container — every band is full-viewport-width, full-viewport-height (or close to it) with photography filling the entire frame.
- Shop product grid: 4-up at desktop, 2-up at tablet, 1-up at mobile.
- Type sits inside an inner ~1200px reading column centered horizontally over the full-bleed photograph.

### Whitespace Philosophy
The marketing pages have minimal traditional whitespace — the photograph occupies all space. "Whitespace" here means the dark sky in a rocket photograph or the empty stretch of Martian terrain. Negative space is photographic, not a UI choice. On the shop site whitespace returns to standard 32px grid gutters.

## Elevation & Depth

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Flat | Default — and the only level on marketing surfaces |
| 1 | Photographic — full-bleed image or video | The primary depth medium; photographs do all the lifting |

The brand does not use drop shadows, blurs, glows, or gradient overlays. Depth is photographic: a rocket launching at twilight has natural atmospheric depth that no CSS shadow could simulate. When type needs separation from imagery, the image is graded darker rather than scrimmed.

### Decorative Depth
Photography and autoplaying rocket-launch video are the only decorative depth. There are no illustrations, no icons beyond a few minimal SVG arrow chevrons in nav and CTA hover states.

## Shapes

### Border Radius Scale

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{rounded.xs}` | 4px | Form inputs (shop site) |
| `{rounded.sm}` | 8px | Shop product card chrome, video frames |
| `{rounded.md}` | 16px | Larger surface chrome |
| `{rounded.pill}` | 32px | Ghost outlined pill CTAs (the brand''s signature button shape) |
| `{rounded.full}` | 9999px | Circular play-button overlays on video frames |

### Photography Geometry
Every photograph is full-viewport-bleed, edge-to-edge, never inset in a card on the marketing site. On the shop site, product photography sits inside `{rounded.sm}` 8px containers with no shadow. Aspect ratios on marketing photography vary with the source image — there is no enforced ratio; the photograph leads.

## Components

### Buttons

**`button-ghost-on-dark`** — the universal CTA on marketing surfaces.
- Background `{colors.canvas-night}` (transparent against the photographed canvas), 1px solid `{colors.on-primary}` border, text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.button-cap}` (uppercase, 13px / 700 / 1.17px tracking), padding `{spacing.lg} {spacing.xl}` (18px 24px), rounded `{rounded.pill}` 32px.

**`button-ghost-on-light`** — the same button on shop / light pages.
- Background `{colors.canvas-light}` (transparent against light canvas), 1px solid `{colors.ink}` border, text `{colors.ink}`, otherwise identical.

**`button-filled-cool`** — fill variant on shop product cards.
- Background `{colors.canvas-cool}`, text `{colors.ink}`, same pill geometry. Used as "Add to cart" or similar product CTAs.

### Cards & Containers

**`card-photo-band`** — full-bleed photographic band on marketing pages.
- Background `{colors.canvas-night}`, padding 0, rounded `{rounded.xs}`. The photograph fills the entire band; type and CTA sit overlaid.

**`card-shop-product`** — product card on the shop site.
- Background `{colors.canvas-light}`, padding `{spacing.md}` 16px, rounded `{rounded.sm}` 8px, 1px `{colors.hairline-on-light}` border. Product photo on top, name in `{typography.body-md}`, price in `{typography.body-md}` 700 weight, "Add to cart" button at the bottom.

### Inputs & Forms

**`text-input`** — form input on the shop site.
- Background `{colors.canvas-light}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.body-md}`, padding `{spacing.sm} {spacing.md}` (12px 16px), rounded `{rounded.xs}` 4px, 1px `{colors.hairline-on-light}` border.

### Navigation

**`nav-bar-overlay`** — top nav across the marketing site.
- Background `{colors.canvas-night}` (transparent over the hero photo), text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.button-cap}` (uppercase). Logo wordmark on the left at ~147×19px, nav items horizontal in caps, padding `{spacing.xl} {spacing.xxl}` (24px 32px). The nav is fixed/sticky on scroll, retaining the overlay treatment.

### Signature Components

**Full-Bleed Photo / Video Hero** — every marketing band is a full-viewport photograph or autoplaying rocket-launch video. Type and CTA sit overlaid on the photograph at high opacity with no scrim. The photograph is graded so type lands cleanly without an overlay layer.

**Uppercase Display Headline** — the 80px D-DIN-Bold uppercase headline with 1.6px positive tracking is the brand''s most recognizable typographic moment. Always uppercase, always bold-weight, always positively tracked.

**`link-on-dark`** — inline links on dark canvas.
- Text `{colors.link-on-dark}` (white) with persistent underline.

**`link-on-light`** — inline links on light canvas.
- Text `{colors.ink}` with persistent underline.

**`footer-dark`** — site-wide footer.
- Background `{colors.canvas-night}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.caption}`, padding `{spacing.xxl} {spacing.xl}` (32px 24px). Holds nav columns in `{typography.micro-cap}` (uppercase), and a small legal/copyright row at the bottom.

## Do''s and Don''ts

### Do
- Use full-bleed photography or autoplaying video as the dominant decorative element on every marketing band.
- Render display tiers in uppercase D-DIN-Bold with positive 0.96–1.6px letter-spacing — the wide tracking is the signature.
- Use a single `{button-ghost-on-dark}` per band — the brand does NOT show two CTAs side by side on marketing surfaces.
- Pair every photograph with type that respects the imagery — no scrims, no gradients, no overlays. Grade the photo, not the canvas.
- Keep nav overlay-style (transparent, white-on-image) on marketing pages.

### Don''t
- Don''t introduce brand accent colors — black, white, and photography are the entire palette.
- Don''t use drop shadows or gradient overlays on dark canvas — they fight the photography.
- Don''t render display tiers in sentence-case or title-case — uppercase is the brand.
- Don''t put filled buttons on marketing surfaces — the ghost outlined pill is the only marketing CTA.
- Don''t use serif or humanist sans alternatives — the condensed industrial DIN cut is non-negotiable.

## Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Wide | ≥ 1500px | Full hero photograph; max-content type column at 1200px |
| Desktop | 1280–1499px | Default desktop layout |
| Laptop | 961–1279px | Type column tightens; photo crops adjust |
| Tablet | 768–960px | Display drops 80 → 60px; nav compresses |
| Mobile | 600–767px | Display drops to 48px; ghost button retains pill shape |
| Small Mobile | < 600px | Display drops to 40px; nav becomes hamburger |

### Touch Targets
- Ghost pill buttons hit ≥ 50×50px due to the 18px vertical padding × 13px line-height. WCAG AAA compliant.
- Form fields stay at the 44px minimum height.

### Collapsing Strategy
- Display sizes stair-step 80 → 60 → 48 → 40px through the breakpoints.
- Photography re-crops to focal subject on smaller widths (rocket centered, Mars landscape centered).
- Top nav collapses to hamburger below 768px; menu retains the dark overlay treatment.
- Shop product grid stair-steps 4-up → 2-up → 1-up.

### Image Behavior
Marketing photography uses `srcset` for desktop / tablet / mobile with art-direction crops at major breakpoints. Mobile crops favor the central focal subject; wide crops favor environmental context (full launch pad, full Martian horizon).

## Iteration Guide

1. Focus on ONE component at a time.
2. Reference component names and tokens directly (`{colors.canvas-night}`, `{button-ghost-on-dark}`, `{rounded.pill}`).
3. Run `npx @google/design.md lint DESIGN.md` after edits.
4. Add new variants as separate entries.
5. Default body to `{typography.body-md}`; reserve `{typography.body-lg}` for marketing leads.
6. The black-and-white-only rule is load-bearing — adding a brand accent color breaks the system.
7. Ghost pill is the only marketing CTA; filled buttons live exclusively on the shop site.

Logo wordmark on the left at ~147×19px, nav items horizontal in caps, padding `{spacing.xl} {spacing.xxl}` (24px 32px). The nav is fixed/sticky on scroll, retaining the overlay treatment.

### Signature Components

**Full-Bleed Photo / Video Hero** — every marketing band is a full-viewport photograph or autoplaying rocket-launch video. Type and CTA sit overlaid on the photograph at high opacity with no scrim. The photograph is graded so type lands cleanly without an overlay layer.

**Uppercase Display Headline** — the 80px D-DIN-Bold uppercase headline with 1.6px positive tracking is the brand''s most recognizable typographic moment. Always uppercase, always bold-weight, always positively tracked.

**`link-on-dark`** — inline links on dark canvas.
- Text `{colors.link-on-dark}` (white) with persistent underline.

**`link-on-light`** — inline links on light canvas.
- Text `{colors.ink}` with persistent underline.

**`footer-dark`** — site-wide footer.
- Background `{colors.canvas-night}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.caption}`, padding `{spacing.xxl} {spacing.xl}` (32px 24px). Holds nav columns in `{typography.micro-cap}` (uppercase), and a small legal/copyright row at the bottom.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/spacex/DESIGN.md","category":"components"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 7),

### Do
- Use full-bleed photography or autoplaying video as the dominant decorative element on every marketing band.
- Render display tiers in uppercase D-DIN-Bold with positive 0.96–1.6px letter-spacing — the wide tracking is the signature.
- Use a single `{button-ghost-on-dark}` per band — the brand does NOT show two CTAs side by side on marketing surfaces.
- Pair every photograph with type that respects the imagery — no scrims, no gradients, no overlays. Grade the photo, not the canvas.
- Keep nav overlay-style (transparent, white-on-image) on marketing pages.

### Don''t
- Don''t introduce brand accent colors — black, white, and photography are the entire palette.
- Don''t use drop shadows or gradient overlays on dark canvas — they fight the photography.
- Don''t render display tiers in sentence-case or title-case — uppercase is the brand.
- Don''t put filled buttons on marketing surfaces — the ghost outlined pill is the only marketing CTA.
- Don''t use serif or humanist sans alternatives — the condensed industrial DIN cut is non-negotiable.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/spacex/DESIGN.md","category":"dos_and_donts"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 8),

### Breakpoints

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Wide | ≥ 1500px | Full hero photograph; max-content type column at 1200px |
| Desktop | 1280–1499px | Default desktop layout |
| Laptop | 961–1279px | Type column tightens; photo crops adjust |
| Tablet | 768–960px | Display drops 80 → 60px; nav compresses |
| Mobile | 600–767px | Display drops to 48px; ghost button retains pill shape |
| Small Mobile | < 600px | Display drops to 40px; nav becomes hamburger |

### Touch Targets
- Ghost pill buttons hit ≥ 50×50px due to the 18px vertical padding × 13px line-height. WCAG AAA compliant.
- Form fields stay at the 44px minimum height.

### Collapsing Strategy
- Display sizes stair-step 80 → 60 → 48 → 40px through the breakpoints.
- Photography re-crops to focal subject on smaller widths (rocket centered, Mars landscape centered).
- Top nav collapses to hamburger below 768px; menu retains the dark overlay treatment.
- Shop product grid stair-steps 4-up → 2-up → 1-up.

### Image Behavior
Marketing photography uses `srcset` for desktop / tablet / mobile with art-direction crops at major breakpoints.

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

Spotify''s web interface is a dark, immersive music player that wraps listeners in a near-black cocoon (`#121212`, `#181818`, `#1f1f1f`) where album art and content become the primary source of color. The design philosophy is "content-first darkness" — the UI recedes into shadow so that music, podcasts, and playlists can glow. Every surface is a shade of charcoal, creating a theater-like environment where the only true color comes from the iconic Spotify Green (`#1ed760`) and the album artwork itself.

The typography uses SpotifyMixUI and SpotifyMixUITitle — proprietary fonts from the CircularSp family (Circular by Lineto, customized for Spotify) with an extensive fallback stack that includes Arabic, Hebrew, Cyrillic, Greek, Devanagari, and CJK fonts, reflecting Spotify''s global reach. The type system is compact and functional: 700 (bold) for emphasis and navigation, 600 (semibold) for secondary emphasis, and 400 (regular) for body. Buttons use uppercase with positive letter-spacing (1.4px–2px) for a systematic, label-like quality.

What distinguishes Spotify is its pill-and-circle geometry. Primary buttons use 500px–9999px radius (full pill), circular play buttons use 50% radius, and search inputs are 500px pills. Combined with heavy shadows (`rgba(0,0,0,0.5) 0px 8px 24px`) on elevated elements and a unique inset border-shadow combo (`rgb(18,18,18) 0px 1px 0px, rgb(124,124,124) 0px 0px 0px 1px inset`), the result is an interface that feels like a premium audio device — tactile, rounded, and built for touch.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Near-black immersive dark theme (`#121212`–`#1f1f1f`) — UI disappears behind content
- Spotify Green (`#1ed760`) as singular brand accent — never decorative, always functional
- SpotifyMixUI/CircularSp font family with global script support
- Pill buttons (500px–9999px) and circular controls (50%) — rounded, touch-optimized
- Uppercase button labels with wide letter-spacing (1.4px–2px)
- Heavy shadows on elevated elements (`rgba(0,0,0,0.5) 0px 8px 24px`)
- Semantic colors: negative red (`#f3727f`), warning orange (`#ffa42b`), announcement blue (`#539df5`)
- Album art as the primary color source — the UI is achromatic by design

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

### Primary Brand
- **Spotify Green** (`#1ed760`): Primary brand accent — play buttons, active states, CTAs
- **Near Black** (`#121212`): Deepest background surface
- **Dark Surface** (`#181818`): Cards, containers, elevated surfaces
- **Mid Dark** (`#1f1f1f`): Button backgrounds, interactive surfaces

### Text
- **White** (`#ffffff`): `--text-base`, primary text
- **Silver** (`#b3b3b3`): Secondary text, muted labels, inactive nav
- **Near White** (`#cbcbcb`): Slightly brighter secondary text
- **Light** (`#fdfdfd`): Near-pure white for maximum emphasis

### Semantic
- **Negative Red** (`#f3727f`): `--text-negative`, error states
- **Warning Orange** (`#ffa42b`): `--text-warning`, warning states
- **Announcement Blue** (`#539df5`): `--text-announcement`, info states

### Surface & Border
- **Dark Card** (`#252525`): Elevated card surface
- **Mid Card** (`#272727`): Alternate card surface
- **Border Gray** (`#4d4d4d`): Button borders on dark
- **Light Border** (`#7c7c7c`): Outlined button borders, muted links
- **Separator** (`#b3b3b3`): Divider lines
- **Light Surface** (`#eeeeee`): Light-mode buttons (rare)
- **Spotify Green Border** (`#1db954`): Green accent border variant

### Shadows
- **Heavy** (`rgba(0,0,0,0.5) 0px 8px 24px`): Dialogs, menus, elevated panels
- **Medium** (`rgba(0,0,0,0.3) 0px 8px 8px`): Cards, dropdowns
- **Inset Border** (`rgb(18,18,18) 0px 1px 0px, rgb(124,124,124) 0px 0px 0px 1px inset`): Input border-shadow combo

## 3. Typography Rules

### Font Families
- **Title**: `SpotifyMixUITitle`, fallbacks: `CircularSp-Arab, CircularSp-Hebr, CircularSp-Cyrl, CircularSp-Grek, CircularSp-Deva, Helvetica Neue, helvetica, arial, Hiragino Sans, Hiragino Kaku Gothic ProN, Meiryo, MS Gothic`
- **UI / Body**: `SpotifyMixUI`, same fallback stack

### Hierarchy

| Role | Font | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Notes |
|------|------|------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Section Title | SpotifyMixUITitle | 24px (1.50rem) | 700 | normal | normal | Bold title weight |
| Feature Heading | SpotifyMixUI | 18px (1.13rem) | 600 | 1.30 (tight) | normal | Semibold section heads |
| Body Bold | SpotifyMixUI | 16px (1.00rem) | 700 | normal | normal | Emphasized text |
| Body | SpotifyMixUI | 16px (1.00rem) | 400 | normal | normal | Standard body |
| Button Uppercase | SpotifyMixUI | 14px (0.88rem) | 600–700 | 1.00 (tight) | 1.4px–2px | `text-transform: uppercase` |
| Button | SpotifyMixUI | 14px (0.88rem) | 700 | normal | 0.14px | Standard button |
| Nav Link Bold | SpotifyMixUI | 14px (0.88rem) | 700 | normal | normal | Navigation |
| Nav Link | SpotifyMixUI | 14px (0.88rem) | 400 | normal | normal | Inactive nav |
| Caption Bold | SpotifyMixUI | 14px (0.88rem) | 700 | 1.50–1.54 | normal | Bold metadata |
| Caption | SpotifyMixUI | 14px (0.88rem) | 400 | normal | normal | Metadata |
| Small Bold | SpotifyMixUI | 12px (0.75rem) | 700 | 1.50 | normal | Tags, counts |
| Small | SpotifyMixUI | 12px (0.75rem) | 400 | normal | normal | Fine print |
| Badge | SpotifyMixUI | 10.5px (0.66rem) | 600 | 1.33 | normal | `text-transform: capitalize` |
| Micro | SpotifyMixUI | 10px (0.63rem) | 400 | normal | normal | Smallest text |

### Principles
- **Bold/regular binary**: Most text is either 700 (bold) or 400 (regular), with 600 used sparingly. This creates a clear visual hierarchy through weight contrast rather than size variation.
- **Uppercase buttons as system**: Button labels use uppercase + wide letter-spacing (1.4px–2px), creating a systematic "label" voice distinct from content text.
- **Compact sizing**: The range is 10px–24px — narrower than most systems. Spotify''s type is compact and functional, designed for scanning playlists, not reading articles.
- **Global script support**: The extensive fallback stack (Arabic, Hebrew, Cyrillic, Greek, Devanagari, CJK) reflects Spotify''s 180+ market reach.

## 4. Component Stylings

### Buttons

**Dark Pill**
- Background: `#1f1f1f`
- Text: `#ffffff` or `#b3b3b3`

**Circular Play**
- Background: `#1f1f1f`
- Text: `#ffffff`
- Padding: 12px
- Radius: 50% (circle)
- Use: Play/pause controls

### Cards & Containers
- Background: `#181818` or `#1f1f1f`
- Radius: 6px–8px
- No visible borders on most cards
- Hover: slight background lightening
- Shadow: `rgba(0,0,0,0.3) 0px 8px 8px` on elevated

### Inputs
- Search input: `#1f1f1f` background, `#ffffff` text
- Radius: 500px (pill)
- Padding: 12px 96px 12px 48px (icon-aware)
- Focus: border becomes `#000000`, outline `1px solid`

### Navigation
- Dark sidebar with SpotifyMixUI 14px weight 700 for active, 400 for inactive
- `#b3b3b3` muted color for inactive items, `#ffffff` for active
- Circular icon buttons (50% radius)
- Spotify logo top-left in green

## 5. Layout Principles

### Spacing System
- Base unit: 8px
- Scale: 1px, 2px, 3px, 4px, 5px, 6px, 8px, 10px, 12px, 14px, 15px, 16px, 20px

### Grid & Container
- Sidebar (fixed) + main content area
- Grid-based album/playlist cards
- Full-width now-playing bar at bottom
- Responsive content area fills remaining space

### Whitespace Philosophy
- **Dark compression**: Spotify packs content densely — playlist grids, track lists, and navigation are all tightly spaced. The dark background provides visual rest between elements without needing large gaps.
- **Content density over breathing room**: This is an app, not a marketing site. Every pixel serves the listening experience.

### Border Radius Scale
- Minimal (2px): Badges, explicit tags
- Subtle (4px): Inputs, small elements
- Standard (6px): Album art containers, cards
- Comfortable (8px): Sections, dialogs
- Medium (10px–20px): Panels, overlay elements
- Large (100px): Large pill buttons
- Pill (500px): Primary buttons, search input
- Full Pill (9999px): Navigation pills, search
- Circle (50%): Play buttons, avatars, icons

## 6. Depth & Elevation

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Base (Level 0) | `#121212` background | Deepest layer, page background |
| Surface (Level 1) | `#181818` or `#1f1f1f` | Cards, sidebar, containers |
| Elevated (Level 2) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.3) 0px 8px 8px` | Dropdown menus, hover cards |
| Dialog (Level 3) | `rgba(0,0,0,0.5) 0px 8px 24px` | Modals, overlays, menus |
| Inset (Border) | `rgb(18,18,18) 0px 1px 0px, rgb(124,124,124) 0px 0px 0px 1px inset` | Input borders |

**Shadow Philosophy**: Spotify uses notably heavy shadows for a dark-themed app. The 0.5 opacity shadow at 24px blur creates a dramatic "floating in darkness" effect for dialogs and menus, while the 0.3 opacity at 8px blur provides a more subtle card lift. The unique inset border-shadow combination on inputs creates a recessed, tactile quality.

## 7. Do''s and Don''ts

### Do
- Use near-black backgrounds (`#121212`–`#1f1f1f`) — depth through shade variation
- Apply Spotify Green (`#1ed760`) only for play controls, active states, and primary CTAs
- Use pill shape (500px–9999px) for all buttons — circular (50%) for play controls
- Apply uppercase + wide letter-spacing (1.4px–2px) on button labels
- Keep typography compact (10px–24px range) — this is an app, not a magazine
- Use heavy shadows (`0.3–0.5 opacity`) for elevated elements on dark backgrounds
- Let album art provide color — the UI itself is achromatic

### Don''t
- Don''t use Spotify Green decoratively or on backgrounds — it''s functional only
- Don''t use light backgrounds for primary surfaces — the dark immersion is core
- Don''t skip the pill/circle geometry on buttons — square buttons break the identity
- Don''t use thin/subtle shadows — on dark backgrounds, shadows need to be heavy to be visible
- Don''t add additional brand colors — green + achromatic grays is the complete palette
- Don''t use relaxed line-heights — Spotify''s typography is compact and dense
- Don''t expose raw gray borders — use shadow-based or inset borders instead

## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints
| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Mobile Small | <425px | Compact mobile layout |
| Mobile | 425–576px | Standard mobile |
| Tablet | 576–768px | 2-column grid |
| Tablet Large | 768–896px | Expanded layout |
| Desktop Small | 896–1024px | Sidebar visible |
| Desktop | 1024–1280px | Full desktop layout |
| Large Desktop | >1280px | Expanded grid |

### Collapsing Strategy
- Sidebar: full → collapsed → hidden
- Album grid: 5 columns → 3 → 2 → 1
- Now-playing bar: maintained at all sizes
- Search: pill input maintained, width adjusts
- Navigation: sidebar → bottom bar on mobile

## 9. Agent Prompt Guide

### Quick Color Reference
- Background: Near Black (`#121212`)
- Surface: Dark Card (`#181818`)
- Text: White (`#ffffff`)
- Secondary text: Silver (`#b3b3b3`)
- Accent: Spotify Green (`#1ed760`)
- Border: `#4d4d4d`
- Error: Negative Red (`#f3727f`)

### Example Component Prompts
- "Create a dark card: #181818 background, 8px radius. Title at 16px SpotifyMixUI weight 700, white text. Subtitle at 14px weight 400, #b3b3b3. Shadow rgba(0,0,0,0.3) 0px 8px 8px on hover."
- "Design a pill button: #1f1f1f background, white text, 9999px radius, 8px 16px padding. 14px SpotifyMixUI weight 700, uppercase, letter-spacing 1.4px."
- "Build a circular play button: Spotify Green (#1ed760) background, #000000 icon, 50% radius, 12px padding."
- "Create search input: #1f1f1f background, white text, 500px radius, 12px 48px padding. Inset border: rgb(124,124,124) 0px 0px 0px 1px inset."
- "Design navigation sidebar: #121212 background. Active items: 14px weight 700, white. Inactive: 14px weight 400, #b3b3b3."

### Iteration Guide
1. Start with #121212 — everything lives in near-black darkness
2. Spotify Green for functional highlights only (play, active, CTA)
3. Pill everything — 500px for large, 9999px for small, 50% for circular
4. Uppercase + wide tracking on buttons — the systematic label voice
5. Heavy shadows (0.3–0.5 opacity) for elevation — light shadows are invisible on dark
6. Album art provides all the color — the UI stays achromatic

### Principles
- **Bold/regular binary**: Most text is either 700 (bold) or 400 (regular), with 600 used sparingly. This creates a clear visual hierarchy through weight contrast rather than size variation.
- **Uppercase buttons as system**: Button labels use uppercase + wide letter-spacing (1.4px–2px), creating a systematic "label" voice distinct from content text.
- **Compact sizing**: The range is 10px–24px — narrower than most systems. Spotify''s type is compact and functional, designed for scanning playlists, not reading articles.
- **Global script support**: The extensive fallback stack (Arabic, Hebrew, Cyrillic, Greek, Devanagari, CJK) reflects Spotify''s 180+ market reach.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/spotify/DESIGN.md","category":"typography"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 4),

### Spacing System
- Base unit: 8px
- Scale: 1px, 2px, 3px, 4px, 5px, 6px, 8px, 10px, 12px, 14px, 15px, 16px, 20px

### Grid & Container
- Sidebar (fixed) + main content area
- Grid-based album/playlist cards
- Full-width now-playing bar at bottom
- Responsive content area fills remaining space

### Whitespace Philosophy
- **Dark compression**: Spotify packs content densely — playlist grids, track lists, and navigation are all tightly spaced. The dark background provides visual rest between elements without needing large gaps.
- **Content density over breathing room**: This is an app, not a marketing site. Every pixel serves the listening experience.

### Border Radius Scale
- Minimal (2px): Badges, explicit tags
- Subtle (4px): Inputs, small elements
- Standard (6px): Album art containers, cards
- Comfortable (8px): Sections, dialogs
- Medium (10px–20px): Panels, overlay elements
- Large (100px): Large pill buttons
- Pill (500px): Primary buttons, search input
- Full Pill (9999px): Navigation pills, search

### Do
- Use near-black backgrounds (`#121212`–`#1f1f1f`) — depth through shade variation
- Apply Spotify Green (`#1ed760`) only for play controls, active states, and primary CTAs
- Use pill shape (500px–9999px) for all buttons — circular (50%) for play controls
- Apply uppercase + wide letter-spacing (1.4px–2px) on button labels
- Keep typography compact (10px–24px range) — this is an app, not a magazine
- Use heavy shadows (`0.3–0.5 opacity`) for elevated elements on dark backgrounds
- Let album art provide color — the UI itself is achromatic

### Don''t
- Don''t use Spotify Green decoratively or on backgrounds — it''s functional only
- Don''t use light backgrounds for primary surfaces — the dark immersion is core
- Don''t skip the pill/circle geometry on buttons — square buttons break the identity
- Don''t use thin/subtle shadows — on dark backgrounds, shadows need to be heavy to be visible
- Don''t add additional brand colors — green + achromatic grays is the complete palette
- Don''t use relaxed line-heights — Spotify''s typography is compact and dense
- Don''t expose raw gray borders — use shadow-based or inset borders instead', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/spotify/DESIGN.md","category":"dos_and_donts"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 8),

2. Spotify Green for functional highlights only (play, active, CTA)
3. Pill everything — 500px for large, 9999px for small, 50% for circular
4. Uppercase + wide tracking on buttons — the systematic label voice
5. Heavy shadows (0.3–0.5 opacity) for elevation — light shadows are invisible on dark

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

Starbucks'' design system is a **warm, confident retail flagship** wearing the green of their storefront apron across every surface. The canvas alternates between a neutral-warm cream (`#f2f0eb`) and a ceramic off-white (`#edebe9`) — colors that reference actual store materials: the paper napkins, the café walls, the wood finishes — while the signature **Starbucks Green** (`#006241`) anchors the brand moment on hero bands, CTAs, and the Rewards experience. The greens come in four calibrated shades (Starbucks, Accent, House, Uplift) each mapped to a specific surface role, and gold (`#cba258`) appears only around Rewards-status ceremony — not as a general accent.

Typography carries most of the brand voice. The proprietary **SoDoSans** typeface (custom to Starbucks) sits across nearly every surface with a tight `-0.16px` letter-spacing — it reads confident and friendly rather than fashion-magazine severe. What''s unusual: the Rewards page switches to a warm serif (`"Lander Tall", "Iowan Old Style", Georgia`) for specific headline moments, subtly echoing the nostalgic feel of a coffeehouse chalkboard. And the Careers pages use a handwritten script (`"Kalam", "Comic Sans MS", cursive`) for personal cup-name touches. Three typefaces, three contexts — the system is disciplined about when each appears.

The surfaces breathe through rounded geometry. Every button is a 50px full-pill. Cards take a 12px rounded-rectangle. The "Frap" floating CTA — a 56px circular order button in Green Accent (`#00754A`) — is the product''s signature depth move: it floats bottom-right with a layered shadow stack (`0 0 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.24)` base + `0 8px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.14)` ambient) and compresses via `scale(0.95)` on press. Elevations are otherwise restrained — card shadows stay at a whispered `0.14/0.24` alpha, global nav gets a quiet three-layer shadow stack. The whole system feels like clean café signage: legible, warm, and never shouting.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Four-tier green brand system (Starbucks / Accent / House / Uplift) each mapped to a distinct surface role — not a single "brand green"
- Gold reserved for Rewards-status moments only; never a general-purpose accent
- Warm-neutral canvas (`#f2f0eb` / `#edebe9`) instead of cold white — references café materials
- Custom proprietary typeface (SoDoSans) with tight `-0.16px` letter-spacing as the universal voice
- Context-specific type switches: serif (Lander Tall) for Rewards, script (Kalam) for Careers cup-names
- Full-pill buttons (`50px` radius) universal, `scale(0.95)` active press the signature micro-interaction
- Floating "Frap" circular CTA (`56px`, Green Accent fill, layered shadow stack) — the product''s signature elevation element
- Gift-card surfaces designed as **photographed physical product** — every card is a distinct illustrated photograph rather than a generated graphic
- 12px card radius + whisper-soft shadows keep content cards flat-plus-hint-of-lift
- Rem-based spacing scale anchored at 1.6rem (~16px) = `--space-3`, stepping to 6.4rem (~64px)

**Color-block page rhythm:** Cream hero → White content sections → Dark-green (`#1E3932`) feature band with white text → Cream utility zone → Dark-green (`#1E3932`) footer with gold / white text — an espresso-dark bookend around the bright body.

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

**Source pages analyzed:** homepage, rewards, gift cards, product detail (Pink Energy Drink), product nutrition (Cold Brew).

### Primary

- **Starbucks Green** (`#006241`): The historic brand green. Used on h1 headings, primary section headers on the Rewards page, and as the main brand signal wherever a single dominant color is needed.
- **Green Accent** (`#00754A`): A slightly brighter, more luminous green. The primary filled-CTA color ("Explore our afternoon menu", "See the spring menu") and the fill of the floating Frap circular button.
- **House Green** (`#1E3932`): The deep near-black brand green. Footer surface, feature-band backgrounds, reward-status dark surfaces, and the headline "Free coffee is just the beginning" hero band on Rewards.
- **Green Uplift** (`#2b5148`): A secondary mid-dark green used sparingly on decorative accents and dark-gradient moments.
- **Green Light** (`#d4e9e2`): A pale mint wash used for form-valid-state tints and light green utility surfaces.

### Secondary & Accent

- **Gold** (`#cba258`): Reserved almost exclusively for Rewards-status ceremony — Gold-tier callouts, partnership badges (SkyMiles, Bonvoy), and premium-feeling accents. Never a general-purpose brand color.
- **Gold Light** (`#dfc49d`): Softer gold for background washes on gold-tier sections.
- **Gold Lightest** (`#faf6ee`): Cream-gold page-surface wash used under partnership sections on the Rewards page — ties the gold accent back into the warm neutral system.

### Surface & Background

- **White** (`#ffffff`): Primary card and modal surface. Also card fill on gift-card tiles.
- **Neutral Cool** (`#f9f9f9`): Subtle cool-gray surface used on dropdown menus ("Account" dropdown), form-card wraps, and quiet utility containers.
- **Neutral Warm** (`#f2f0eb`): The warm cream **primary page canvas** for Rewards utility zones and hero bands.
- **Ceramic** (`#edebe9`): A slightly warmer/darker cream for zone separators, soft page-section washes, and Rewards partnership band.
- **Black** (`#000000`): Deep ink reserved for the dark top-of-page CTA strip ("Join now") and high-contrast top-nav sign-in buttons.

### Neutrals & Text

- **Text Black** (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87)`): Primary heading and body text color on light surfaces. Not pure black — an 87%-opacity black that reads warmer.
- **Text Black Soft** (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.58)`): Secondary/metadata text on light surfaces.
- **Text White** (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)`): Primary heading/body text on dark green surfaces.
- **Text White Soft** (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.70)`): Secondary text on dark-green surfaces — footer link descriptions, caption text.
- **Rewards Green** (`#33433d`): A dedicated muted slate-green used only on Rewards-page text blocks — a slightly "dustier" reading color than Text Black that signals "reward surface" without using full Starbucks Green.

### Semantic & Accent

- **Red** (`#c82014`): Error and destructive state (form invalid, destructive actions).
- **Yellow** (`#fbbc05`): Warning state, legacy brand touch.
- **Green Light** (`#d4e9e2` at 33% opacity = `hsl(160 32% 87% / 33%)`): Form valid-field tint background.
- **Red Tint** (`hsl(4 82% 43% / 5%)`): Invalid-field tint on forms.

### Black / White Alpha Ladders

Two parallel translucent scales for overlay and secondary-text use:
- `rgba(0,0,0,0.06)` through `rgba(0,0,0,0.90)` in 10% steps — for dark overlays on light surfaces
- `rgba(255,255,255,0.10)` through `rgba(255,255,255,0.90)` in 10% steps — for light overlays on dark surfaces

### Gradient System

No structural gradient tokens observed. Surface hierarchy is solid-color-block throughout — the system relies on its five-tier cream/green surface palette rather than gradients.

## 3. Typography Rules

### Font Family

- **Primary:** `SoDoSans, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif` — Starbucks'' proprietary corporate typeface, used across nearly every surface
- **Loading Fallback:** `"Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif` — what users see before SoDoSans loads
- **Rewards Serif:** `"Lander Tall", "Iowan Old Style", Georgia, serif` — used on specific Rewards-page headline moments for a warm editorial feel
- **Careers Script:** `"Kalam", "Comic Sans MS", cursive` — used exclusively for Careers-page "cup name" decorative touches, referencing the hand-written names on Starbucks cups

No OpenType stylistic sets explicitly activated at `:root`.

### Hierarchy

| Role | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Display (text-10) | 5.0rem / 80px | 400–600 | 1.2 | -0.16px | Largest Rewards/hero display |
| Jumbo (text-9) | 3.6rem / 58px | 400–600 | 1.2 | -0.16px | Secondary hero headings |
| Hero Large (text-8) | 2.8rem / 45px | 400–600 | 1.2–1.5 | -0.16px | Landing section headlines |
| H1 | 24px | 600 | 36px | -0.16px | Starbucks-Green primary heading |
| H2 | 24px | 400 | 36px | -0.16px | Regular-weight section title in Text Black |
| Body Large | 19px | 400–600 | 33.25px (~1.75) | -0.16px | Hero intro copy, feature-band body |
| Body (text-3) | 1.6rem / 16px | 400 | 1.5 (24px) | -0.01em | Default body copy |
| Small (text-2) | 1.4rem / ~14px | 400–600 | 1.5 | -0.01em | Button label, metadata, form labels |
| Micro (text-1) | 1.3rem / ~13px | 400 | 1.5 | -0.01em | Active float-label state, caption micro-copy |
| Button Label | 14–16px | 400–600 | 1.2 | -0.01em | All pill-button labels |

**Letter-spacing tokens:**
- `letterSpacingNormal`: `-0.01em` (default — tight, characteristic)
- `letterSpacingLoose`: `0.1em` (emphasized caps)
- `letterSpacingLooser`: `0.15em` (uppercase-style labels, extreme emphasis)

**Line-height tokens:**
- `lineHeightNormal`: `1.5` (body)
- `lineHeightCompact`: `1.2` (display/buttons)

### Principles

- **Tight negative tracking (`-0.01em`)** is applied almost universally — the entire product reads slightly compressed, which gives SoDoSans its confident presence without feeling squeezed.
- **Weight shifts carry hierarchy, not size shifts.** H1 and H2 share the same 24px/36px size; only weight (600 vs 400) and color (Starbucks-Green vs Text Black) separate them.
- **Size tokens use rem, anchored to `1rem = 10px`** on this site (via a `font-size: 62.5%` root trick). So `1.6rem` = 16px, `2.4rem` = 24px, etc. The scale is semantic (textSize-1 through textSize-10), not arbitrary pixel values.
- **Context-specific typeface swaps** — serif on Rewards, script on Careers — are deliberate and localized. Never mix them with the primary sans within the same surface.
- **Body text never goes pure black** — it sits at `rgba(0,0,0,0.87)` to match the warm-neutral canvas temperature.

### Note on Font Substitutes

SoDoSans is proprietary to Starbucks (licensed from House Industries, not publicly available). Reasonable open-source substitutes:
- **Inter** (Google Fonts) — similar humanist geometric proportions, wide weight range
- **Manrope** — slightly rounder, similar confident feel
- **Nunito Sans** — warmer, good for a "café" brand substitute

If substituting, verify the tight `-0.01em` / `-0.16px` tracking still reads well; some open-source fonts need `-0.005em` instead.

Lander Tall (the Rewards serif) is custom — open-source substitutes: **Iowan Old Style** (already in fallback), **Lora**, or **Source Serif Pro**. Kalam (Careers script) is available on Google Fonts directly.

**Gift Card Tile**
- Background: illustrated photography fills the card (no solid bg)
- Radius: similar to cards (`~12px`, slightly tighter on corners)
- Shadow: lighter than default card — these are treated like physical cards laid on the canvas
- Labeled by category above the card grid (Spring, Thank You, Birthday, Celebration, Mother''s Day, Appreciation, Encouragement, Milestones, Anytime)

**Rewards Status Cards (Rewards page signature)**
- Three-column grid: Bronze / Gold / Silver-ish — each a dark-green (`#1E3932`) panel with:
  - Colored gradient/color header ring
  - Numbered "Level" badge

- Combined vertical padding: `11.2rem`
- Radius inherits from card spec (`12px`)

### Inputs & Forms

**Floating Label Input**
- Label floats above the input border when focused/filled
- Desktop label font size: `1.9rem` default, animates to `1.4rem` when active
- Mobile label font size: `1.6rem` default, animates to `1.3rem` active
- Label horizontal offset: `12px` from left
- Active label translate: up to `-12px` with `-50%` Y translation
- Field padding: `12px`
- Form horizontal padding: `1.6rem`
- Validation: valid-field gets `rgba(green-light, 0.33)` tint; invalid-field gets `rgba(red, 0.05)` tint
- Transition: `0.3s option-label-marker-expansion cubic-bezier(0.32, 2.32, 0.61, 0.27)` on checked-input

**Option Icon (checkbox/radio)**
- Padding: `3px` inner
- Uses the checked-input cubic-bezier animation above (a slightly "springy" 2.32 overshoot curve)

### Navigation

**Global Nav (top bar)**
- Fixed position with progressive heights: `64px` xs → `72px` mobile → `83px` tablet → `99px` desktop
- Shadow stack: `0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1), 0 2px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.06), 0 0 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.07)` — three-layer soft lift
- Left: Starbucks wordmark logo, offsetting by `99px` (md) / `131px` (lg) from left edge
- Primary links inline in SoDoSans weight 400–600: Menu · Rewards · Gift Cards
- Right: Find a store link + Sign in (outlined) + Join now (black filled)

**Sub-nav (second bar, e.g., Rewards internal)**
- Height: `53px` (global subnav) / `48px` (internal subnav)
- Typically horizontal tab group beneath the global nav

**Mobile Nav**
- Collapses to a hamburger drawer below tablet breakpoint
- Frap floating button persists at bottom-right regardless of nav state

### Image Treatment

- **Hero photography**: Product photos (beverages in clear glass with colored backgrounds — coral, sage, warm amber) occupy ~40vw of a split-hero layout; text occupies the other 60vw (`--headerCrateProportion: 40vw` / `--contentCrateProportion: 60vw`)
- **Gift card illustrations**: Each card is a distinct illustrated photograph (painted-feel, hand-drawn-looking, warm color palette). Never generic generated graphics.
- **Rewards ceremony imagery**: Photographs of Starbucks Rewards App screens held in-hand, angled compositions — product-in-context photography.
- **Menu thumbnails**: Square or 4:3 product photography with clean white/cream backdrops, slight soft drop-shadow around the glass.
- **Image fade-in**: `opacity 0.3s ease-in` transition on image load (`--imageFadeTransition`).

### Feature Band (dark-green hero strip)

## 5. Layout Principles

### Spacing System

Rem-based semantic scale (anchored `1rem = 10px`):

| Token | Rem | Pixels | Typical Use |
|-------|-----|--------|-------------|
| `--space-1` | `0.4rem` | 4px | Tightest inline padding |
| `--space-2` | `0.8rem` | 8px | Small gap, button vertical padding |
| `--space-3` | `1.6rem` | 16px | Default — card padding, outer gutter xs |
| `--space-4` | `2.4rem` | 24px | Section inner spacing, outer gutter md |
| `--space-5` | `3.2rem` | 32px | Major between-section spacing |
| `--space-6` | `4rem` | 40px | Large gaps, outer gutter lg, header crate |
| `--space-7` | `4.8rem` | 48px | Section-to-section spacing |
| `--space-8` | `5.6rem` | 56px | Very large breathing — Frap height |
| `--space-9` | `6.4rem` | 64px | Widest section padding |

**Gutter tokens:**
- `--outerGutter: 1.6rem` (16px, default / mobile)
- `--outerGutterMedium: 2.4rem` (24px, tablet)
- `--outerGutterLarge: 4.0rem` (40px, desktop)

**Universal rhythm constant:** `1.6rem` (16px) appears across every page as the default outer gutter, card padding baseline, and text size 3 body — the system''s most frequent spacing unit.

### Grid & Container

- Column width scale: `--columnWidthSmall: 343px` / `Medium: 500px` / `Large: 720px` / `XLarge: 1440px`
- Gift-card grid uses a 3-5-up responsive grid of `~343px` tiles
- Rewards status section: 3-up dark-green panels at `lg+` breakpoints
- Hero: asymmetric split 40% (image) / 60% (content) via `--headerCrateProportion` / `--contentCrateProportion`

### Whitespace Philosophy

Whitespace carries the feeling of "plenty of space in the café." Section padding leans generous (40–64px). Content blocks are separated by whitespace rather than dividers. The cream canvas (`#f2f0eb`) is itself a visual breath between white cards and green feature bands.

### Border Radius Scale

| Value | Use |
|-------|-----|
| `12px` | Cards, modals, menu-item tiles (`--cardBorderRadius`) |
| `12px 12px 0 0` | Full-width feedback tab (top-rounded only) |
| `50px` | All buttons — full-pill radius (`--buttonBorderRadius`) |
| `50%` | Circular icons, Frap floating button, avatar thumbnails |
| Specialty | `3.3333%/5.298%` elliptical for Starbucks-Visa-Card mockups (`--svcRoundedCorners`) |

## 6. Depth & Elevation

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Card | `0 0 0.5px rgba(0,0,0,0.14), 0 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.24)` | Default content cards — a whisper-soft dual-shadow |
| Global Nav | `0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1), 0 2px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.06), 0 0 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.07)` | Triple-layer soft lift on the fixed top bar |
| Frap Base | `0 0 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.24)` | Base halo around the floating circular CTA |
| Frap Ambient | `0 8px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.14)` | Stacked directional ambient — floats the Frap forward |
| Gift Card | Light drop shadow around illustrated photograph | Physical-card feel for gift tiles |
| Starbucks Card (SVC) | `drop-shadow(0 4px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.11)) drop-shadow(0 0 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.24))` | Stacked SVG drop shadows for Starbucks Card visuals |

**Shadow philosophy:** Whisper-soft, layered over solid — the system never reaches for a single heavy drop shadow. Instead, it stacks 2–3 low-alpha shadows with different offsets to simulate real-world ambient + direct lighting. The Frap button is the most elevated element on any page.

### Decorative Depth

- **No gradient system** — surfaces are solid color-block
- **Color-block banding** carries perceived depth (dark-green bands read as "recessed feature zones" between cream/white body sections)
- **SVG filter shadows** on Starbucks-Card visuals add a slight 3D physicality without a box-shadow

## 7. Do''s and Don''ts

### Do
- Use Neutral Warm (`#f2f0eb`) or Ceramic (`#edebe9`) as page canvas instead of pure white — the warm cream is the signature
- Map the green tiers to their intended surface role — Starbucks Green for headings, Green Accent for CTAs, House Green for deep bands, Uplift for decorative
- Keep tracking tight at `-0.01em` / `-0.16px` on SoDoSans across the whole system
- Use 50px full-pill radius on every button without exception
- Apply `transform: scale(0.95)` as the universal button active state
- Reserve Gold for Rewards-status ceremony moments only
- Use SoDoSans for nearly everything; switch to Lander Tall serif only for Rewards editorial headlines; reserve Kalam script for Careers "cup name" moments
- Layer 2–3 low-alpha shadows instead of one heavier drop shadow for elevation
- Use the Frap circular CTA as the persistent floating order entry on every shopping surface
- Let the cream canvas breathe between content cards — use whitespace, not dividers

### Don''t
- Don''t use pure white as the page canvas — the warm cream temperature is load-bearing
- Don''t pick "one brand green" — the four-green system is intentional; using only `#006241` everywhere flattens the brand
- Don''t use Gold as a general-purpose accent — it''s a Rewards signal only
- Don''t square the corners on buttons — the 50px pill is universal
- Don''t introduce gradient fills — the system is color-block throughout
- Don''t weight-contrast h1 and h2 by size — the hierarchy comes from weight + color (600 Starbucks-Green vs 400 Text Black)
- Don''t use pure black for body text — `rgba(0,0,0,0.87)` matches the warm canvas
- Don''t skip the `scale(0.95)` active feedback on buttons — it''s a signature micro-interaction
- Don''t stack single heavy shadows; always layer 2–3 low-alpha ones
- Don''t introduce serifs or scripts into the main shopping flow — they belong to Rewards and Careers contexts respectively

## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints

Inferred from component width tokens and progressive nav heights:

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|------|-------|-------------|
| xs | < 480px | Global nav 64px; hamburger menu; single-column layouts; pill buttons full-width |
| Mobile | 480–767px | Global nav 72px; gift-card grid 2-up; card padding tightens |
| Tablet | 768–1023px | Global nav 83px; gift-card grid 3-up; hero split begins to appear |
| Desktop | 1024–1439px | Global nav 99px; gift-card grid 4-up; full asymmetric hero 40/60 |
| XLarge | 1440px+ | Content caps at `--columnWidthXLarge`; gift-card grid 5-up; extra cream margin |

### Touch Targets

- Pill buttons at `7px 16px` padding measure ~32px tall — below 44px WCAG AAA minimum for touch-only surfaces. On mobile, button padding may be visually expanded to meet the minimum.
- Frap floating circular button at `56px` is well above minimum.
- Frap uses `--frapTouchOffset: calc(-1 * .8rem)` to extend tap area 8px beyond visual edge.
- Form float-label inputs grow their label font size on mobile (1.6rem base vs 1.9rem desktop) — easier to tap and read at arm''s-length.

### Collapsing Strategy

- **Global nav height scales progressively**: 64 → 72 → 83 → 99px across breakpoints, not a single value
- **Hero split collapses**: 40/60 asymmetric split → stacked (image top, content below) at mobile
- **Gift-card grid**: 5-up → 4-up → 3-up → 2-up → 1-up across breakpoints with adjusted card widths
- **Feature bands**: Stay full-width but text + imagery stack vertically on mobile
- **Outer gutter scales**: 16px → 24px → 40px as viewport grows
- **Rewards 3-column status panels**: Stack to single column on mobile

### Image Behavior

- Hero product photography crops tighter vertically on mobile; content becomes the visual anchor
- Gift-card illustrations preserve aspect ratio; card grid reflows
- `opacity 0.3s ease-in` fade-in transition on image load (prevents jarring pop-in)
- Rewards app-in-hand photography scales proportionally; never stretches

### Example Component Prompts

1. "Create a primary Starbucks CTA pill button with Green Accent (`#00754A`) background, white text ''Explore our afternoon menu'', SoDoSans font at 16px weight 600 with `-0.01em` letter-spacing, `50px` border-radius (full pill), `7px 16px` padding. Apply `transform: scale(0.95)` as the active state with a `0.2s ease` transition."

2. "Design a content card with White (`#ffffff`) background at `12px` border-radius, layered shadow `0 0 0.5px rgba(0,0,0,0.14), 0 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.24)`. Pad contents `16–24px` (`--space-3` to `--space-4`). Place on a Neutral Warm (`#f2f0eb`) page canvas with `16px` gap to siblings."

3. "Build the Frap floating circular order button — `56px` diameter, Green Accent (`#00754A`) fill, white shopping-bag icon centered. Layered shadow: `0 0 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.24)` + `0 8px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.14)`. Fixed position bottom-right with `-0.8rem` touch offset. Active state collapses the ambient shadow to `0 8px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0)` with `scale(0.95)`."

4. "Build a dark-green feature band — full-width section with House Green (`#1E3932`) background. Left column: white SoDoSans h2 at 24px weight 600, followed by a Text White Soft (`rgba(255,255,255,0.70)`) body paragraph and a CTA row with two buttons (White-filled with Green Accent text for primary, Outlined-on-Dark white border for secondary). Right column: product photography. Split ratio 40/60, stacked vertically below `768px`."

5. "Create a Rewards status card — House Green (`#1E3932`) panel with `12px` border-radius, colored gradient top stripe (Bronze/Silver/Gold tier). Title in SoDoSans 24px weight 600 in white. Benefits list as white bullets with `rgba(255,255,255,0.70)` secondary captions. Bottom progression text in Text White Soft. Stack 3 panels in a grid at `lg+`, single column on mobile."

6. "Design a gift-card tile — card radius matches `12px`, fills with an illustrated photograph (hand-drawn watercolor-painted feel) as the entire surface. Subtle drop shadow makes it feel like a physical card on the cream canvas. Group under a category label (''Spring'', ''Thank You'', ''Birthday'') in SoDoSans 24px weight 400 above the grid."

7. "Create a Starbucks product-detail header — House Green (`#1E3932`) band with breadcrumb ''Menu / Refreshers / Pink Energy Drink'' in 14/400 white above the product title in SoDoSans 32/700 uppercase white. Product photograph centered below title. Below photo: a 4-up size selector row — each cup-icon button shows a vertical cup silhouette, size name (''Tall'' / ''Grande'' / ''Venti'' / ''Trenta'') in 16/700 white, and fluid-ounce in 13/400 Text White Soft. Selected size wraps the cup icon in a `2px solid #00754A` circular ring."

8. "Build a Starbucks customize flow — under the size selector, 3 stacked outlined-rectangle input rows (white bg, `1px solid #d6dbde` border, `4px` radius). Each has a floating label (''Add-ins'', ''Milk'', ''Add-ins'') above the top border in 13/700 Text Black uppercase. Value centered (e.g., ''Ice'', ''Coconut''). Right side: chevron-down in Text Black Soft. For the scoop row, embed a numeric stepper (`−` `1` `+` with circular `32px` outlined buttons). Below all three fields: outlined green ''Customize'' pill with gold sparkle icon, `50px` radius, `14px 40px` padding. Pair with a Green Accent filled ''Add to Order'' pill in the same row."

9. "Design a Starbucks product description band — full-width House Green (`#1E3932`) below product header. Top: a gold-outlined ''200★ item'' Rewards Cost Pill (`50px` radius, `4px 12px` padding, gold `#cba258` border and text). Below: product description in white 16/400/1.5. Nutritional inline summary in white 14/700 (''140 calories, 25g sugar, 2.5g fat'') with info-icon tooltip. Outlined-white-on-green pill button ''Full nutrition &amp; ingredients list''. 32px vertical padding."

10. "Create a Starbucks nutrition facts table — two-column layout inside a White card. Left column: ''Ingredients'' header (24/400 Text Black), followed by ingredient list or ''Not available for this item'' placeholder paragraph in 14/400 Text Black Soft. Right column: ''Nutrition'' header, then label/value rows (nutrient name left, value right) separated by `1px solid #e7e7e7` hairlines. Typography: labels in 14/400 Text Black, values in 14/700 Text Black right-aligned. Footnote asterisk markers in 13/400 Text Black Soft at the bottom."

### Iteration Guide

When refining existing screens generated with this design system:
1. Focus on ONE component at a time
2. Reference specific color names and hex codes from this document
3. Use natural language descriptions ("warm cream canvas," "four-tier green system") alongside exact values
4. Preserve the 50px pill + `scale(0.95)` active state universally
5. Check that greens are mapped to their correct role (Green Accent for CTA, Starbucks Green for heading, House Green for band)
6. Don''t introduce gradients — the system is color-block
7. Keep SoDoSans tracking at `-0.01em` / `-0.16px` across the board

### Known Gaps

- SoDoSans is a proprietary typeface not available on Google Fonts — when implementing publicly, use Inter or Manrope as a substitute and document the swap
- Lander Tall (Rewards serif) is also custom — substitute with Iowan Old Style, Lora, or Source Serif Pro
- Specific per-component animation timings beyond the few documented (`--duration: 0.4s`, `--iconTransition: all ease-out 0.2s`, `--expanderDuration: 300ms`) are not captured for every interactive surface
- Form error-state full styling (red border weight, icon placement) visible on the tint token but not exhaustively extracted
- Careers-page specific components (cup-name card, search radio grid) are referenced in token names but not covered by this extraction
- Starbucks Visa Card / Starbucks-Card (SVC) detailed mockup specs are hinted at by `--svcRoundedCorners` and `--svcShadowFilter` tokens but not fully documented

Starbucks'' design system is a **warm, confident retail flagship** wearing the green of their storefront apron across every surface. The canvas alternates between a neutral-warm cream (`#f2f0eb`) and a ceramic off-white (`#edebe9`) — colors that reference actual store materials: the paper napkins, the café walls, the wood finishes — while the signature **Starbucks Green** (`#006241`) anchors the brand moment on hero bands, CTAs, and the Rewards experience. The greens come in four calibrated shades (Starbucks, Accent, House, Uplift) each mapped to a specific surface role, and gold (`#cba258`) appears only around Rewards-status ceremony — not as a general accent.

Typography carries most of the brand voice. The proprietary **SoDoSans** typeface (custom to Starbucks) sits across nearly every surface with a tight `-0.16px` letter-spacing — it reads confident and friendly rather than fashion-magazine severe. What''s unusual: the Rewards page switches to a warm serif (`"Lander Tall", "Iowan Old Style", Georgia`) for specific headline moments, subtly echoing the nostalgic feel of a coffeehouse chalkboard. And the Careers pages use a handwritten script (`"Kalam", "Comic Sans MS", cursive`) for personal cup-name touches. Three typefaces, three contexts — the system is disciplined about when each appears.

The surfaces breathe through rounded geometry. Every button is a 50px full-pill. Cards take a 12px rounded-rectangle. The "Frap" floating CTA — a 56px circular order button in Green Accent (`#00754A`) — is the product''s signature depth move: it floats bottom-right with a layered shadow stack (`0 0 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.24)` base + `0 8px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.14)` ambient) and compresses via `scale(0.95)` on press. Elevations are otherwise restrained — card shadows stay at a whispered `0.14/0.24` alpha, global nav gets a quiet three-layer shadow stack. The whole system feels like clean café signage: legible, warm, and never shouting.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Four-tier green brand system (Starbucks / Accent / House / Uplift) each mapped to a distinct surface role — not a single "brand green"
- Gold reserved for Rewards-status moments only; never a general-purpose accent
- Warm-neutral canvas (`#f2f0eb` / `#edebe9`) instead of cold white — references café materials
- Custom proprietary typeface (SoDoSans) with tight `-0.16px` letter-spacing as the universal voice
- Context-specific type switches: serif (Lander Tall) for Rewards, script (Kalam) for Careers cup-names
- Full-pill buttons (`50px` radius) universal, `scale(0.95)` active press the signature micro-interaction
- Floating "Frap" circular CTA (`56px`, Green Accent fill, layered shadow stack) — the product''s signature elevation element
- Gift-card surfaces designed as **photographed physical product** — every card is a distinct illustrated photograph rather than a generated graphic
- 12px card radius + whisper-soft shadows keep content cards flat-plus-hint-of-lift
- Rem-based spacing scale anchored at 1.6rem (~16px) = `--space-3`, stepping to 6.4rem (~64px)

**Color-block page rhythm:** Cream hero → White content sections → Dark-green (`#1E3932`) feature band with white text → Cream utility zone → Dark-green (`#1E3932`) footer with gold / white text — an espresso-dark bookend around the bright body.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/starbucks/DESIGN.md","category":"overview"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 2),

**Source pages analyzed:** homepage, rewards, gift cards, product detail (Pink Energy Drink), product nutrition (Cold Brew).

### Primary

- **Starbucks Green** (`#006241`): The historic brand green. Used on h1 headings, primary section headers on the Rewards page, and as the main brand signal wherever a single dominant color is needed.
- **Green Accent** (`#00754A`): A slightly brighter, more luminous green. The primary filled-CTA color ("Explore our afternoon menu", "See the spring menu") and the fill of the floating Frap circular button.
- **House Green** (`#1E3932`): The deep near-black brand green. Footer surface, feature-band backgrounds, reward-status dark surfaces, and the headline "Free coffee is just the beginning" hero band on Rewards.
- **Green Uplift** (`#2b5148`): A secondary mid-dark green used sparingly on decorative accents and dark-gradient moments.
- **Green Light** (`#d4e9e2`): A pale mint wash used for form-valid-state tints and light green utility surfaces.

### Secondary & Accent

- **Gold** (`#cba258`): Reserved almost exclusively for Rewards-status ceremony — Gold-tier callouts, partnership badges (SkyMiles, Bonvoy), and premium-feeling accents. Never a general-purpose brand color.
- **Gold Light** (`#dfc49d`): Softer gold for background washes on gold-tier sections.
- **Gold Lightest** (`#faf6ee`): Cream-gold page-surface wash used under partnership sections on the Rewards page — ties the gold accent back into the warm neutral system.

### Surface & Background

- **White** (`#ffffff`): Primary card and modal surface. Also card fill on gift-card tiles.
- **Neutral Cool** (`#f9f9f9`): Subtle cool-gray surface used on dropdown menus ("Account" dropdown), form-card wraps, and quiet utility containers.
- **Neutral Warm** (`#f2f0eb`): The warm cream **primary page canvas** for Rewards utility zones and hero bands.
- **Ceramic** (`#edebe9`): A slightly warmer/darker cream for zone separators, soft page-section washes, and Rewards partnership band.
- **Black** (`#000000`): Deep ink reserved for the dark top-of-page CTA strip ("Join now") and high-contrast top-nav sign-in buttons.

### Neutrals & Text

- **Text Black** (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87)`): Primary heading and body text color on light surfaces. Not pure black — an 87%-opacity black that reads warmer.
- **Text Black Soft** (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.58)`): Secondary/metadata text on light surfaces.
- **Text White** (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)`): Primary heading/body text on dark green surfaces.
- **Text White Soft** (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.70)`): Secondary text on dark-green surfaces — footer link descriptions, caption text.
- **Rewards Green** (`#33433d`): A dedicated muted slate-green used only on Rewards-page text blocks — a slightly "dustier" reading color than Text Black that signals "reward surface" without using full Starbucks Green.

### Semantic & Accent

- **Red** (`#c82014`): Error and destructive state (form invalid, destructive actions).
- **Yellow** (`#fbbc05`): Warning state, legacy brand touch.
- **Green Light** (`#d4e9e2` at 33% opacity = `hsl(160 32% 87% / 33%)`): Form valid-field tint background.
- **Red Tint** (`hsl(4 82% 43% / 5%)`): Invalid-field tint on forms.

### Black / White Alpha Ladders

Two parallel translucent scales for overlay and secondary-text use:
- `rgba(0,0,0,0.06)` through `rgba(0,0,0,0.90)` in 10% steps — for dark overlays on light surfaces
- `rgba(255,255,255,0.10)` through `rgba(255,255,255,0.90)` in 10% steps — for light overlays on dark surfaces

### Gradient System

No structural gradient tokens observed. Surface hierarchy is solid-color-block throughout — the system relies on its five-tier cream/green surface palette rather than gradients.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/starbucks/DESIGN.md","category":"colors"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 3),
((select id from d), 'typography', '3. Typography Rules', 'typography', '## 3. Typography Rules

### Font Family

- **Primary:** `SoDoSans, "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif` — Starbucks'' proprietary corporate typeface, used across nearly every surface
- **Loading Fallback:** `"Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif` — what users see before SoDoSans loads
- **Rewards Serif:** `"Lander Tall", "Iowan Old Style", Georgia, serif` — used on specific Rewards-page headline moments for a warm editorial feel
- **Careers Script:** `"Kalam", "Comic Sans MS", cursive` — used exclusively for Careers-page "cup name" decorative touches, referencing the hand-written names on Starbucks cups

No OpenType stylistic sets explicitly activated at `:root`.

### Hierarchy

| Role | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Display (text-10) | 5.0rem / 80px | 400–600 | 1.2 | -0.16px | Largest Rewards/hero display |
| Jumbo (text-9) | 3.6rem / 58px | 400–600 | 1.2 | -0.16px | Secondary hero headings |
| Hero Large (text-8) | 2.8rem / 45px | 400–600 | 1.2–1.5 | -0.16px | Landing section headlines |
| H1 | 24px | 600 | 36px | -0.16px | Starbucks-Green primary heading |
| H2 | 24px | 400 | 36px | -0.16px | Regular-weight section title in Text Black |
| Body Large | 19px | 400–600 | 33.25px (~1.75) | -0.16px | Hero intro copy, feature-band body |
| Body (text-3) | 1.6rem / 16px | 400 | 1.5 (24px) | -0.01em | Default body copy |
| Small (text-2) | 1.4rem / ~14px | 400–600 | 1.5 | -0.01em | Button label, metadata, form labels |
| Micro (text-1) | 1.3rem / ~13px | 400 | 1.5 | -0.01em | Active float-label state, caption micro-copy |
| Button Label | 14–16px | 400–600 | 1.2 | -0.01em | All pill-button labels |

**Letter-spacing tokens:**
- `letterSpacingNormal`: `-0.01em` (default — tight, characteristic)
- `letterSpacingLoose`: `0.1em` (emphasized caps)
- `letterSpacingLooser`: `0.15em` (uppercase-style labels, extreme emphasis)

**Line-height tokens:**
- `lineHeightNormal`: `1.5` (body)
- `lineHeightCompact`: `1.2` (display/buttons)

### Principles

- **Tight negative tracking (`-0.01em`)** is applied almost universally — the entire product reads slightly compressed, which gives SoDoSans its confident presence without feeling squeezed.
- **Weight shifts carry hierarchy, not size shifts.** H1 and H2 share the same 24px/36px size; only weight (600 vs 400) and color (Starbucks-Green vs Text Black) separate them.
- **Size tokens use rem, anchored to `1rem = 10px`** on this site (via a `font-size: 62.5%` root trick). So `1.6rem` = 16px, `2.4rem` = 24px, etc. The scale is semantic (textSize-1 through textSize-10), not arbitrary pixel values.
- **Context-specific typeface swaps** — serif on Rewards, script on Careers — are deliberate and localized. Never mix them with the primary sans within the same surface.
- **Body text never goes pure black** — it sits at `rgba(0,0,0,0.87)` to match the warm-neutral canvas temperature.

### Note on Font Substitutes

SoDoSans is proprietary to Starbucks (licensed from House Industries, not publicly available). Reasonable open-source substitutes:
- **Inter** (Google Fonts) — similar humanist geometric proportions, wide weight range
- **Manrope** — slightly rounder, similar confident feel
- **Nunito Sans** — warmer, good for a "café" brand substitute

If substituting, verify the tight `-0.01em` / `-0.16px` tracking still reads well; some open-source fonts need `-0.005em` instead.

Lander Tall (the Rewards serif) is custom — open-source substitutes: **Iowan Old Style** (already in fallback), **Lora**, or **Source Serif Pro**. Kalam (Careers script) is available on Google Fonts directly.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/starbucks/DESIGN.md","category":"typography"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 4),

- Typically horizontal tab group beneath the global nav

**Mobile Nav**
- Collapses to a hamburger drawer below tablet breakpoint
- Frap floating button persists at bottom-right regardless of nav state

### Image Treatment

- **Hero photography**: Product photos (beverages in clear glass with colored backgrounds — coral, sage, warm amber) occupy ~40vw of a split-hero layout; text occupies the other 60vw (`--headerCrateProportion: 40vw` / `--contentCrateProportion: 60vw`)
- **Gift card illustrations**: Each card is a distinct illustrated photograph (painted-feel, hand-drawn-looking, warm color palette). Never generic generated graphics.
- **Rewards ceremony imagery**: Photographs of Starbucks Rewards App screens held in-hand, angled compositions — product-in-context photography.
- **Menu thumbnails**: Square or 4:3 product photography with clean white/cream backdrops, slight soft drop-shadow around the glass.
- **Image fade-in**: `opacity 0.3s ease-in` transition on image load (`--imageFadeTransition`).

### Spacing System

Rem-based semantic scale (anchored `1rem = 10px`):

| Token | Rem | Pixels | Typical Use |
|-------|-----|--------|-------------|
| `--space-1` | `0.4rem` | 4px | Tightest inline padding |
| `--space-2` | `0.8rem` | 8px | Small gap, button vertical padding |
| `--space-3` | `1.6rem` | 16px | Default — card padding, outer gutter xs |
| `--space-4` | `2.4rem` | 24px | Section inner spacing, outer gutter md |
| `--space-5` | `3.2rem` | 32px | Major between-section spacing |
| `--space-6` | `4rem` | 40px | Large gaps, outer gutter lg, header crate |
| `--space-7` | `4.8rem` | 48px | Section-to-section spacing |
| `--space-8` | `5.6rem` | 56px | Very large breathing — Frap height |
| `--space-9` | `6.4rem` | 64px | Widest section padding |

**Gutter tokens:**
- `--outerGutter: 1.6rem` (16px, default / mobile)
- `--outerGutterMedium: 2.4rem` (24px, tablet)
- `--outerGutterLarge: 4.0rem` (40px, desktop)

**Universal rhythm constant:** `1.6rem` (16px) appears across every page as the default outer gutter, card padding baseline, and text size 3 body — the system''s most frequent spacing unit.

### Grid & Container

- Column width scale: `--columnWidthSmall: 343px` / `Medium: 500px` / `Large: 720px` / `XLarge: 1440px`
- Gift-card grid uses a 3-5-up responsive grid of `~343px` tiles
- Rewards status section: 3-up dark-green panels at `lg+` breakpoints
- Hero: asymmetric split 40% (image) / 60% (content) via `--headerCrateProportion` / `--contentCrateProportion`

### Whitespace Philosophy

Whitespace carries the feeling of "plenty of space in the café." Section padding leans generous (40–64px). Content blocks are separated by whitespace rather than dividers. The cream canvas (`#f2f0eb`) is itself a visual breath between white cards and green feature bands.

### Border Radius Scale

| Value | Use |
|-------|-----|
| `12px` | Cards, modals, menu-item tiles (`--cardBorderRadius`) |
| `12px 12px 0 0` | Full-width feedback tab (top-rounded only) |
| `50px` | All buttons — full-pill radius (`--buttonBorderRadius`) |
| `50%` | Circular icons, Frap floating button, avatar thumbnails |
| Specialty | `3.3333%/5.298%` elliptical for Starbucks-Visa-Card mockups (`--svcRoundedCorners`) |', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/starbucks/DESIGN.md","category":"layout"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 6),
((select id from d), 'elevation', '6. Depth & Elevation', 'elevation', '## 6. Depth & Elevation

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Card | `0 0 0.5px rgba(0,0,0,0.14), 0 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.24)` | Default content cards — a whisper-soft dual-shadow |
| Global Nav | `0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1), 0 2px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.06), 0 0 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.07)` | Triple-layer soft lift on the fixed top bar |
| Frap Base | `0 0 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.24)` | Base halo around the floating circular CTA |
| Frap Ambient | `0 8px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.14)` | Stacked directional ambient — floats the Frap forward |
| Gift Card | Light drop shadow around illustrated photograph | Physical-card feel for gift tiles |
| Starbucks Card (SVC) | `drop-shadow(0 4px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.11)) drop-shadow(0 0 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.24))` | Stacked SVG drop shadows for Starbucks Card visuals |

**Shadow philosophy:** Whisper-soft, layered over solid — the system never reaches for a single heavy drop shadow. Instead, it stacks 2–3 low-alpha shadows with different offsets to simulate real-world ambient + direct lighting. The Frap button is the most elevated element on any page.

### Decorative Depth

- **No gradient system** — surfaces are solid color-block
- **Color-block banding** carries perceived depth (dark-green bands read as "recessed feature zones" between cream/white body sections)
- **SVG filter shadows** on Starbucks-Card visuals add a slight 3D physicality without a box-shadow', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/starbucks/DESIGN.md","category":"elevation"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 7),
((select id from d), 'dos_and_donts', '7. Do''s and Don''ts', 'dos_and_donts', '## 7. Do''s and Don''ts

### Do
- Use Neutral Warm (`#f2f0eb`) or Ceramic (`#edebe9`) as page canvas instead of pure white — the warm cream is the signature
- Map the green tiers to their intended surface role — Starbucks Green for headings, Green Accent for CTAs, House Green for deep bands, Uplift for decorative
- Keep tracking tight at `-0.01em` / `-0.16px` on SoDoSans across the whole system
- Use 50px full-pill radius on every button without exception
- Apply `transform: scale(0.95)` as the universal button active state
- Reserve Gold for Rewards-status ceremony moments only
- Use SoDoSans for nearly everything; switch to Lander Tall serif only for Rewards editorial headlines; reserve Kalam script for Careers "cup name" moments
- Layer 2–3 low-alpha shadows instead of one heavier drop shadow for elevation
- Use the Frap circular CTA as the persistent floating order entry on every shopping surface
- Let the cream canvas breathe between content cards — use whitespace, not dividers

### Don''t
- Don''t use pure white as the page canvas — the warm cream temperature is load-bearing
- Don''t pick "one brand green" — the four-green system is intentional; using only `#006241` everywhere flattens the brand
- Don''t use Gold as a general-purpose accent — it''s a Rewards signal only
- Don''t square the corners on buttons — the 50px pill is universal
- Don''t introduce gradient fills — the system is color-block throughout
- Don''t weight-contrast h1 and h2 by size — the hierarchy comes from weight + color (600 Starbucks-Green vs 400 Text Black)
- Don''t use pure black for body text — `rgba(0,0,0,0.87)` matches the warm canvas
- Don''t skip the `scale(0.95)` active feedback on buttons — it''s a signature micro-interaction
- Don''t stack single heavy shadows; always layer 2–3 low-alpha ones
- Don''t introduce serifs or scripts into the main shopping flow — they belong to Rewards and Careers contexts respectively', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/starbucks/DESIGN.md","category":"dos_and_donts"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 8),

### Breakpoints

Inferred from component width tokens and progressive nav heights:

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|------|-------|-------------|
| xs | < 480px | Global nav 64px; hamburger menu; single-column layouts; pill buttons full-width |
| Mobile | 480–767px | Global nav 72px; gift-card grid 2-up; card padding tightens |
| Tablet | 768–1023px | Global nav 83px; gift-card grid 3-up; hero split begins to appear |
| Desktop | 1024–1439px | Global nav 99px; gift-card grid 4-up; full asymmetric hero 40/60 |
| XLarge | 1440px+ | Content caps at `--columnWidthXLarge`; gift-card grid 5-up; extra cream margin |

### Touch Targets

- Pill buttons at `7px 16px` padding measure ~32px tall — below 44px WCAG AAA minimum for touch-only surfaces. On mobile, button padding may be visually expanded to meet the minimum.
- Frap floating circular button at `56px` is well above minimum.
- Frap uses `--frapTouchOffset: calc(-1 * .8rem)` to extend tap area 8px beyond visual edge.
- Form float-label inputs grow their label font size on mobile (1.6rem base vs 1.9rem desktop) — easier to tap and read at arm''s-length.

### Collapsing Strategy

- **Global nav height scales progressively**: 64 → 72 → 83 → 99px across breakpoints, not a single value
- **Hero split collapses**: 40/60 asymmetric split → stacked (image top, content below) at mobile
- **Gift-card grid**: 5-up → 4-up → 3-up → 2-up → 1-up across breakpoints with adjusted card widths
- **Feature bands**: Stay full-width but text + imagery stack vertically on mobile
- **Outer gutter scales**: 16px → 24px → 40px as viewport grows
- **Rewards 3-column status panels**: Stack to single column on mobile

### Image Behavior

- Hero product photography crops tighter vertically on mobile; content becomes the visual anchor
- Gift-card illustrations preserve aspect ratio; card grid reflows
- `opacity 0.3s ease-in` fade-in transition on image load (prevents jarring pop-in)
- Rewards app-in-hand photography scales proportionally; never stretches', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/starbucks/DESIGN.md","category":"responsive_guidelines"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 9),

### Example Component Prompts

1. "Create a primary Starbucks CTA pill button with Green Accent (`#00754A`) background, white text ''Explore our afternoon menu'', SoDoSans font at 16px weight 600 with `-0.01em` letter-spacing, `50px` border-radius (full pill), `7px 16px` padding. Apply `transform: scale(0.95)` as the active state with a `0.2s ease` transition."

2. "Design a content card with White (`#ffffff`) background at `12px` border-radius, layered shadow `0 0 0.5px rgba(0,0,0,0.14), 0 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.24)`. Pad contents `16–24px` (`--space-3` to `--space-4`). Place on a Neutral Warm (`#f2f0eb`) page canvas with `16px` gap to siblings."

3. "Build the Frap floating circular order button — `56px` diameter, Green Accent (`#00754A`) fill, white shopping-bag icon centered. Layered shadow: `0 0 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.24)` + `0 8px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.14)`. Fixed position bottom-right with `-0.8rem` touch offset. Active state collapses the ambient shadow to `0 8px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0)` with `scale(0.95)`."

4. "Build a dark-green feature band — full-width section with House Green (`#1E3932`) background. Left column: white SoDoSans h2 at 24px weight 600, followed by a Text White Soft (`rgba(255,255,255,0.70)`) body paragraph and a CTA row with two buttons (White-filled with Green Accent text for primary, Outlined-on-Dark white border for secondary). Right column: product photography. Split ratio 40/60, stacked vertically below `768px`."

5. "Create a Rewards status card — House Green (`#1E3932`) panel with `12px` border-radius, colored gradient top stripe (Bronze/Silver/Gold tier). Title in SoDoSans 24px weight 600 in white. Benefits list as white bullets with `rgba(255,255,255,0.70)` secondary captions. Bottom progression text in Text White Soft. Stack 3 panels in a grid at `lg+`, single column on mobile."

6. "Design a gift-card tile — card radius matches `12px`, fills with an illustrated photograph (hand-drawn watercolor-painted feel) as the entire surface. Subtle drop shadow makes it feel like a physical card on the cream canvas. Group under a category label (''Spring'', ''Thank You'', ''Birthday'') in SoDoSans 24px weight 400 above the grid."

7. "Create a Starbucks product-detail header — House Green (`#1E3932`) band with breadcrumb ''Menu / Refreshers / Pink Energy Drink'' in 14/400 white above the product title in SoDoSans 32/700 uppercase white. Product photograph centered below title. Below photo: a 4-up size selector row — each cup-icon button shows a vertical cup silhouette, size name (''Tall'' / ''Grande'' / ''Venti'' / ''Trenta'') in 16/700 white, and fluid-ounce in 13/400 Text White Soft. Selected size wraps the cup icon in a `2px solid #00754A` circular ring."

8. "Build a Starbucks customize flow — under the size selector, 3 stacked outlined-rectangle input rows (white bg, `1px solid #d6dbde` border, `4px` radius). Each has a floating label (''Add-ins'', ''Milk'', ''Add-ins'') above the top border in 13/700 Text Black uppercase. Value centered (e.g., ''Ice'', ''Coconut''). Right side: chevron-down in Text Black Soft. For the scoop row, embed a numeric stepper (`−` `1` `+` with circular `32px` outlined buttons). Below all three fields: outlined green ''Customize'' pill with gold sparkle icon, `50px` radius, `14px 40px` padding. Pair with a Green Accent filled ''Add to Order'' pill in the same row."

9. "Design a Starbucks product description band — full-width House Green (`#1E3932`) below product header. Top: a gold-outlined ''200★ item'' Rewards Cost Pill (`50px` radius, `4px 12px` padding, gold `#cba258` border and text). Below: product description in white 16/400/1.5. Nutritional inline summary in white 14/700 (''140 calories, 25g sugar, 2.5g fat'') with info-icon tooltip. Outlined-white-on-green pill button ''Full nutrition &amp; ingredients list''. 32px vertical padding."

10. "Create a Starbucks nutrition facts table — two-column layout inside a White card. Left column: ''Ingredients'' header (24/400 Text Black), followed by ingredient list or ''Not available for this item'' placeholder paragraph in 14/400 Text Black Soft. Right column: ''Nutrition'' header, then label/value rows (nutrient name left, value right) separated by `1px solid #e7e7e7` hairlines. Typography: labels in 14/400 Text Black, values in 14/700 Text Black right-aligned. Footnote asterisk markers in 13/400 Text Black Soft at the bottom."

### Iteration Guide

When refining existing screens generated with this design system:
1. Focus on ONE component at a time
2. Reference specific color names and hex codes from this document
3. Use natural language descriptions ("warm cream canvas," "four-tier green system") alongside exact values
4. Preserve the 50px pill + `scale(0.95)` active state universally
5. Check that greens are mapped to their correct role (Green Accent for CTA, Starbucks Green for heading, House Green for band)
6. Don''t introduce gradients — the system is color-block
7. Keep SoDoSans tracking at `-0.01em` / `-0.16px` across the board

### Known Gaps

- SoDoSans is a proprietary typeface not available on Google Fonts — when implementing publicly, use Inter or Manrope as a substitute and document the swap
- Lander Tall (Rewards serif) is also custom — substitute with Iowan Old Style, Lora, or Source Serif Pro
- Specific per-component animation timings beyond the few documented (`--duration: 0.4s`, `--iconTransition: all ease-out 0.2s`, `--expanderDuration: 300ms`) are not captured for every interactive surface
- Form error-state full styling (red border weight, icon placement) visible on the tint token but not exhaustively extracted
- Careers-page specific components (cup-name card, search radio grid) are referenced in token names but not covered by this extraction
- Starbucks Visa Card / Starbucks-Card (SVC) detailed mockup specs are hinted at by `--svcRoundedCorners` and `--svcShadowFilter` tokens but not fully documented', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/starbucks/DESIGN.md","category":"other"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 10);

description: An inspired interpretation of Stripi''s design language — a financial-infrastructure brand built on a deep navy ink, an electric indigo primary, and a recurring atmospheric gradient mesh that occupies the upper third of nearly every marketing page. The system pairs the proprietary Sohne family at thin (300) weights with negative letter-spacing for editorial-density display headlines, and uses tabular-figure body type where money and numerics matter. Buttons are tight-radius pills, cards live on near-white surfaces, and the dashboard track flips polarity to a familiar dark-app shell.

## Overview

Stripi''s design language opens with the gradient mesh. A wide horizontal band of pastel cream, sherbet orange, lavender, electric indigo, and ruby pink occupies the upper third of nearly every marketing page — the brand''s instantly-recognizable atmospheric backdrop. Type and product UI mockups float above it on `{colors.canvas}` (white), with the gradient acting as both decoration and visual anchor. The lower portion of the page returns to white, with feature explanations on `{colors.canvas-soft}` (a barely-tinted cool off-white) and dashboard product mockups composited as faux IDE/console panels in deep navy.

The color system has two primary roles. **Indigo** (`{colors.primary}` — `#533afd`) is the brand''s signature CTA color, used sparingly: one filled pill per band. **Deep navy** (`{colors.ink}` — `#0d253d`) is the universal body text color and the fill of dashboard mockups, the featured pricing tier, and the dark-app surfaces on the dashboard track. Ruby (`{colors.ruby}`) and magenta (`{colors.magenta}`) appear inside the gradient mesh and as accent dots in product UI mockups; they are not used as button colors.

Typography is built around **Sohne** at weight 300 with negative letter-spacing — the brand''s editorial-density display signature. Display sizes (32–56px) use -1.4px to -0.64px tracking; body sizes use 0; tabular caption sizes (where money and numerics matter) use the OpenType `tnum` feature plus a tightening -0.36 to -0.42px tracking. The `ss01` stylistic set is enabled across all roles.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Gradient-mesh backdrop on every marketing hero — cream/orange/lavender/indigo/ruby horizontally washed across the upper third of the page.
- Single-indigo CTA hierarchy: filled `{colors.primary}` pill is the only filled button on marketing surfaces.
- Sohne thin (weight 300) display tier with negative tracking from -1.4px to -0.2px depending on size.
- Tabular-figure body type (`tnum`) for any cell containing money or numerics — the brand''s quiet financial-data signal.
- Dark-app dashboard track: deep navy product UI mockups sit composited above the white canvas, frequently with rendered code or dashboard tables inside.
- Pill-shaped buttons (`{rounded.pill}` 9999px) with tight `8px 16px` padding — short, decisive, transactional.
- Cream-band feature cards (`{colors.canvas-cream}`) introduce a warm interlude between blue/white sections without breaking the brand''s chromatic logic.

## Colors

> **Source pages:** home (`/`), `/payments`, `/pricing`, `dashboard.stripe.com/register/payments`.

### Brand & Accent
- **Indigo** (`{colors.primary}` — `#533afd`): The brand''s signature CTA color. Filled-pill button, link emphasis, gradient anchor.
- **Indigo Deep** (`{colors.primary-deep}` — `#4434d4`): A deeper indigo used in gradient mid-stops and as the press-state warmer alternative.
- **Indigo Press** (`{colors.primary-press}` — `#2e2b8c`): Pressed-state lift of the primary.
- **Indigo Soft** (`{colors.primary-soft}` — `#665efd`): A lighter indigo used in product-UI accents and chart highlights.
- **Indigo Subdued** (`{colors.primary-bg-subdued-hover}` — `#b9b9f9`): Pale indigo fill used as soft tag background.
- **Brand Dark 900** (`{colors.brand-dark-900}` — `#1c1e54`): The deep navy used on the featured pricing tier and dashboard chrome.
- **Ruby** (`{colors.ruby}` — `#ea2261`): Gradient accent and chart highlight; never a button.
- **Magenta** (`{colors.magenta}` — `#f96bee`): Brighter pink stop in gradient meshes.
- **Lemon** (`{colors.lemon}` — `#9b6829`): Warm sherbet stop in gradient backdrops.

### Surface
- **Canvas** (`{colors.canvas}` — `#ffffff`): Default page background.
- **Canvas Soft** (`{colors.canvas-soft}` — `#f6f9fc`): Cool-tinted off-white used on feature bands beneath the gradient hero.
- **Canvas Cream** (`{colors.canvas-cream}` — `#f5e9d4`): Warm cream used as a feature-band fill — the brand''s chromatic interlude.
- **Hairline** (`{colors.hairline}` — `#e3e8ee`): 1px borders on cards and tables.
- **Hairline Input** (`{colors.hairline-input}` — `#a8c3de`): Slightly cooler hairline used on form inputs.

### Text
- **Ink** (`{colors.ink}` — `#0d253d`): Default body text color across the brand. Deep navy, never pure black.
- **Ink Secondary** (`{colors.ink-secondary}` — `#273951`): Secondary text on white.
- **Ink Mute** (`{colors.ink-mute}` — `#64748d`): Helper text, captions, table labels.
- **Ink Mute 2** (`{colors.ink-mute-2}` — `#61718a`): Near-equivalent to ink-mute used in nav.
- **On Primary** (`{colors.on-primary}` — `#ffffff`): Text on indigo / dark-navy surfaces.

### Semantic
The brand does not use a separate semantic color palette in the marketing system — error / success states live in dashboard-product UI specifically.

## Typography

### Font Family

The display and UI tier is **Sohne** (proprietary, licensed from Klim Type Foundry) at weights 300 (thin) and 400 (regular). The variable font (`sohne-var`) is loaded with `font-feature-settings: "ss01"` enabled globally — the stylistic set substitutes a single-story `a` and other character variants that are part of the brand''s typographic signature.

When Sohne is unavailable, fall back to **SF Pro Display** at thin weights, then system-ui. For maximum brand fidelity, **Inter** (open-source) at weight 300 with `font-feature-settings: "ss01"` and `letter-spacing: -1.4px` on display sizes approximates the rhythm closely.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-xxl}` | 56px | 300 | 1.03 | -1.4px | Hero headline |
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 48px | 300 | 1.15 | -0.96px | Section opener |
| `{typography.display-lg}` | 32px | 300 | 1.1 | -0.64px | Card title / sub-section |
| `{typography.display-md}` | 26px | 300 | 1.12 | -0.26px | Compact card title |
| `{typography.heading-lg}` | 22px | 300 | 1.1 | -0.22px | Pricing tier name |
| `{typography.heading-md}` | 20px | 300 | 1.4 | -0.2px | Section sub-heading |
| `{typography.heading-sm}` | 18px | 300 | 1.4 | 0 | Mini-section label |
| `{typography.body-lg}` | 16px | 300 | 1.4 | 0 | Marketing body lead |
| `{typography.body-md}` | 15px | 300 | 1.4 | 0 | Default UI body |
| `{typography.body-tabular}` | 14px | 300 | 1.4 | -0.42px | Money / numeric tables (uses `tnum`) |
| `{typography.button-md}` | 16px | 400 | 1.0 | 0 | Pill button label |
| `{typography.button-sm}` | 14px | 400 | 1.0 | 0 | Compact pill label |
| `{typography.caption}` | 13px | 400 | 1.4 | -0.39px | Helper, table labels |
| `{typography.micro}` | 11px | 300 | 1.4 | 0 | Fine print |
| `{typography.micro-cap}` | 10px | 400 | 1.15 | 0.1px | All-caps eyebrow |

### Principles
- **Thin weight is the brand.** Display tiers always render at weight 300. Bumping to 400+ removes the brand''s editorial air.
- **Negative tracking on display.** -1.4px at 56px, scaling proportionally down to -0.2px at 20px. The negative tracking is the brand''s typographic signature.
- **Tabular figures for money.** Any cell rendering currency, transaction amounts, or numeric counts uses `font-feature-settings: "tnum"` plus a tightening tracking. The brand quietly signals its financial DNA through this micro-detail.
- **`ss01` globally.** Apply `font-feature-settings: "ss01"` to the body element so the stylistic-set substitution is on for every text role.

### Note on Font Substitutes
Sohne is proprietary. Use **Inter** (open-source via Google Fonts) at weight 300 with `letter-spacing: -1.4px` and `font-feature-settings: "ss01"` for display tiers — Inter is the closest open-source analogue. For body sizes, Inter at 300 weight with `font-feature-settings: "tnum"` (where applicable) is the canonical substitute. Avoid Helvetica or system-ui defaults — they''re heavier than the brand needs.

## Layout

### Spacing System
- **Base unit**: 8px (with 2 / 4 / 12 sub-tokens for fine work).
- **Tokens**: `{spacing.xxs}` 2px · `{spacing.xs}` 4px · `{spacing.sm}` 8px · `{spacing.md}` 12px · `{spacing.lg}` 16px · `{spacing.xl}` 24px · `{spacing.xxl}` 32px · `{spacing.huge}` 64px.
- **Section padding**: 64–96px on marketing surfaces; 32–48px on dashboard / product surfaces.
- **Card internal padding**: 32px on feature cards; 24px on dashboard mockups.

### Grid & Container
- Marketing pages center in a ~1200px container with the gradient mesh extending edge-to-edge above.
- Pricing collapses 4-up → 2-up → 1-up at 1024 / 768 breakpoints.
- Dashboard product mockups use their own internal grids (12-col tables, 3-col card grids) rendered as static composites.

### Whitespace Philosophy
The gradient mesh occupies the upper third of the page; the white canvas below is generously padded. Section gaps tend toward 96px, with content tightening to 32px on dashboard / pricing pages where users compare and act.

## Elevation & Depth

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Flat | Default surface |
| 1 | `box-shadow: rgba(0,55,112,0.08) 0 1px 3px` | Card lift on white |
| 2 | `box-shadow: rgba(0,55,112,0.08) 0 8px 24px, rgba(0,55,112,0.04) 0 2px 6px` | Floating panels, dashboard mockup chrome |
| 3 | Gradient mesh backdrop | The brand''s primary depth medium — atmospheric color rather than literal shadow |

### Decorative Depth
The gradient mesh IS the depth system. Implemented as a layered SVG or large background image rather than CSS gradients (the actual mesh has organic blob shapes that aren''t CSS-renderable). The mesh provides the brand''s signature lift; literal shadows are reserved for product-UI mockups and stay subtle.

## Shapes

### Border Radius Scale

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{rounded.xs}` | 4px | Hairline tags, table chrome |
| `{rounded.sm}` | 6px | Form inputs |
| `{rounded.md}` | 8px | Compact cards, alerts |
| `{rounded.lg}` | 12px | Pricing cards, feature cards |
| `{rounded.xl}` | 16px | Dashboard product mockup chrome |
| `{rounded.pill}` | 9999px | All buttons, tag pills |

### Photography Geometry
The brand uses **product UI mockups** more than photography. Dashboard composites render as faux IDE/terminal/dashboard chrome inside `{rounded.lg}` 12px containers with a subtle `box-shadow`. Real photography appears in customer logo strips and the rare case-study card; treated as inset 4:3 with no shadow.

## Components

### Buttons

**`button-primary-pill`** — the dominant CTA system-wide.
- Background `{colors.primary}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.button-md}`, padding `{spacing.sm} {spacing.lg}` (8px 16px), rounded `{rounded.pill}` 9999px.
- Pressed state `button-primary-pill-pressed` shifts background to `{colors.primary-press}`.

**`button-secondary`** — outline-style alternative.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.primary}`, 1px solid `{colors.primary}` border, same pill geometry.

**`button-on-dark`** — used on dashboard / dark surfaces.
- Background `{colors.brand-dark-900}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, same pill geometry.

### Cards & Containers

**`card-feature-light`** — feature explanation card on white.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, padding `{spacing.xxl}`, rounded `{rounded.lg}` 12px, 1px `{colors.hairline}` border, optional Level 1 shadow.

**`card-pricing`** — standard pricing tier.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, padding `{spacing.xxl}`, rounded `{rounded.lg}`, 1px `{colors.hairline}` border. Title `{typography.heading-lg}`, price `{typography.display-md}`, body `{typography.body-md}`, CTA pinned bottom as `button-primary-pill`.

**`card-pricing-featured`** — the inverted dark featured tier.
- Background `{colors.brand-dark-900}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, otherwise identical structure to `card-pricing`. The deep-navy fill is the brand''s distinctive featured-tier choice.

**`card-cream-band`** — warm interlude card.
- Background `{colors.canvas-cream}`, text `{colors.ink}`, padding `{spacing.xxl}`, rounded `{rounded.lg}`. Used to break up the indigo / white rhythm with warmth.

**`card-dashboard-mockup`** — composited dashboard / product UI screenshot.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, type `{typography.body-tabular}` (with `tnum`), padding `{spacing.xl}` 24px, rounded `{rounded.lg}` 12px, Level 2 shadow. Often contains nested mini-mockups: code preview + dashboard table + chart card.

### Inputs & Forms

**`text-input`** — standard form field.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.body-md}`, padding `{spacing.sm} {spacing.md}` (8px 12px), rounded `{rounded.sm}` 6px, 1px `{colors.hairline-input}` border.
- Focus state `text-input-focused`: border swaps to `{colors.primary}`.

### Navigation

**`nav-bar-on-mesh`** — top nav floating over the gradient hero.
- Background `{colors.canvas}` (or transparent depending on scroll), text `{colors.ink}`, padding `{spacing.lg} {spacing.xl}`. Logo wordmark on the left, primary nav center, sign-in + filled `button-primary-pill` on the right.

### Pills, Tags, and Chips

**`pill-tag-soft`** — subdued indigo tag.
- Background `{colors.primary-bg-subdued-hover}`, text `{colors.primary-deep}`, type `{typography.micro-cap}`, padding `4px 8px`, rounded `{rounded.pill}`.

### Signature Components

**Gradient Mesh Backdrop** — pastel cream → sherbet orange → lavender → indigo → ruby pink stops blurred horizontally across the upper third of the page. Implemented as SVG or a large background image — not a flat CSS gradient (the real mesh has organic blob shapes).

**Composited Dashboard Mockup** — multi-layer faux-product-UI compositions: an IDE panel on the left, a dashboard table center, a chart card on the right, all rendered at small scale inside `{rounded.lg}` containers with subtle Level 2 shadows. The composite is the brand''s most-photographed feature.

**Tabular-Figure Money Type** — every number rendering money, count, or transaction value uses `font-feature-settings: "tnum"`. The brand''s quiet signal that it''s a financial-infrastructure platform.

**`link-on-light`** — inline links on light surfaces.
- Text `{colors.primary}` rendered in `{typography.body-md}`, no underline by default.

**`footer-light`** — site-wide footer.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink-mute}`, type `{typography.caption}`, padding `{spacing.huge} {spacing.xl}` (64px 24px). Holds 4–6 columns of link groups, social icons, and a small legal row.

## Do''s and Don''ts

### Do
- Reserve `{colors.primary}` for filled CTAs and inline link emphasis — it should appear sparingly, one filled button per band.
- Apply the gradient mesh to every marketing hero; bare-canvas heroes feel off-brand.
- Render display tiers at weight 300 with negative letter-spacing — the thin tracking is the typographic signature.
- Use `font-feature-settings: "tnum"` on every money / numeric cell.
- Apply `font-feature-settings: "ss01"` globally on the body element.
- Pair every feature explanation with a composited product UI mockup; the brand''s argument is "look at the actual product."

### Don''t
- Don''t bump display weight above 300 — at 400 the brand''s editorial air collapses.
- Don''t add new accent colors outside the documented gradient stops (cream / orange / lavender / indigo / ruby / magenta).
- Don''t use the indigo `{colors.primary}` as a body-text color — it''s a CTA and link color, not a type color at body size.
- Don''t shrink button padding below `8px 16px` — the tight pill is part of the brand''s transactional feel.
- Don''t render money cells without `tnum` — it breaks the quiet financial-data signature.
- Don''t replace the pill shape with rounded-rectangles for buttons.

## Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Wide | ≥ 1440px | Full gradient mesh edge-to-edge; dashboard composite at full scale |
| Desktop | 1024–1440px | Default content max-width; pricing 4-up |
| Tablet | 768–1023px | Pricing 2-up; dashboard composite simplifies to 2 panels |
| Mobile | < 768px | Pricing 1-up; hamburger nav; display drops 56 → 36px |

### Touch Targets
- Pill buttons hit ≥ 40×40px on mobile via padding scaling. On smaller screens, buttons size up to 44×44px to maintain WCAG AAA.
- Form fields stay at 40px minimum height.

### Collapsing Strategy
- Display tiers stair-step 56 → 48 → 32 → 26 → 22px through the breakpoints.
- Gradient mesh re-tiles on mobile to preserve the wash without disappearing.
- Dashboard composites simplify to single-panel mockups on mobile; the multi-layer composition only renders at desktop+.
- Pricing tiers stair-step 4-up → 2-up → 1-up.

### Image Behavior
Product UI composites use `srcset` with art-direction crops at major breakpoints. Mobile crops focus on the most actionable inner panel; desktop crops show the full multi-layer composition.

## Iteration Guide

1. Focus on ONE component at a time.
2. Reference component names and tokens directly (`{colors.primary}`, `{button-primary-pill}-pressed`, `{rounded.pill}`).
3. Run `npx @google/design.md lint DESIGN.md` after edits.
4. Add new variants as separate entries.
5. Default body to `{typography.body-md}` (15px); use `{typography.body-tabular}` for any money / numeric cell.
6. Apply `ss01` globally on the body; apply `tnum` per-element on numeric content.
7. The gradient mesh is non-negotiable on marketing heroes — bare-canvas heroes break the brand.

- **Canvas Cream** (`{colors.canvas-cream}` — `#f5e9d4`): Warm cream used as a feature-band fill — the brand''s chromatic interlude.
- **Hairline** (`{colors.hairline}` — `#e3e8ee`): 1px borders on cards and tables.
- **Hairline Input** (`{colors.hairline-input}` — `#a8c3de`): Slightly cooler hairline used on form inputs.

### Text
- **Ink** (`{colors.ink}` — `#0d253d`): Default body text color across the brand. Deep navy, never pure black.
- **Ink Secondary** (`{colors.ink-secondary}` — `#273951`): Secondary text on white.
- **Ink Mute** (`{colors.ink-mute}` — `#64748d`): Helper text, captions, table labels.
- **Ink Mute 2** (`{colors.ink-mute-2}` — `#61718a`): Near-equivalent to ink-mute used in nav.
- **On Primary** (`{colors.on-primary}` — `#ffffff`): Text on indigo / dark-navy surfaces.

### Semantic
The brand does not use a separate semantic color palette in the marketing system — error / success states live in dashboard-product UI specifically.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/stripe/DESIGN.md","category":"colors"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 2),

### Font Family

The display and UI tier is **Sohne** (proprietary, licensed from Klim Type Foundry) at weights 300 (thin) and 400 (regular). The variable font (`sohne-var`) is loaded with `font-feature-settings: "ss01"` enabled globally — the stylistic set substitutes a single-story `a` and other character variants that are part of the brand''s typographic signature.

When Sohne is unavailable, fall back to **SF Pro Display** at thin weights, then system-ui. For maximum brand fidelity, **Inter** (open-source) at weight 300 with `font-feature-settings: "ss01"` and `letter-spacing: -1.4px` on display sizes approximates the rhythm closely.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-xxl}` | 56px | 300 | 1.03 | -1.4px | Hero headline |
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 48px | 300 | 1.15 | -0.96px | Section opener |

| `{typography.display-md}` | 26px | 300 | 1.12 | -0.26px | Compact card title |

| `{typography.button-sm}` | 14px | 400 | 1.0 | 0 | Compact pill label |

| `{typography.micro-cap}` | 10px | 400 | 1.15 | 0.1px | All-caps eyebrow |

### Principles
- **Thin weight is the brand.** Display tiers always render at weight 300. Bumping to 400+ removes the brand''s editorial air.
- **Negative tracking on display.** -1.4px at 56px, scaling proportionally down to -0.2px at 20px. The negative tracking is the brand''s typographic signature.
- **Tabular figures for money.** Any cell rendering currency, transaction amounts, or numeric counts uses `font-feature-settings: "tnum"` plus a tightening tracking. The brand quietly signals its financial DNA through this micro-detail.
- **`ss01` globally.** Apply `font-feature-settings: "ss01"` to the body element so the stylistic-set substitution is on for every text role.

### Note on Font Substitutes
Sohne is proprietary. Use **Inter** (open-source via Google Fonts) at weight 300 with `letter-spacing: -1.4px` and `font-feature-settings: "ss01"` for display tiers — Inter is the closest open-source analogue. For body sizes, Inter at 300 weight with `font-feature-settings: "tnum"` (where applicable) is the canonical substitute. Avoid Helvetica or system-ui defaults — they''re heavier than the brand needs.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/stripe/DESIGN.md","category":"typography"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 3),

### Spacing System
- **Base unit**: 8px (with 2 / 4 / 12 sub-tokens for fine work).
- **Tokens**: `{spacing.xxs}` 2px · `{spacing.xs}` 4px · `{spacing.sm}` 8px · `{spacing.md}` 12px · `{spacing.lg}` 16px · `{spacing.xl}` 24px · `{spacing.xxl}` 32px · `{spacing.huge}` 64px.
- **Section padding**: 64–96px on marketing surfaces; 32–48px on dashboard / product surfaces.
- **Card internal padding**: 32px on feature cards; 24px on dashboard mockups.

### Grid & Container
- Marketing pages center in a ~1200px container with the gradient mesh extending edge-to-edge above.
- Pricing collapses 4-up → 2-up → 1-up at 1024 / 768 breakpoints.
- Dashboard product mockups use their own internal grids (12-col tables, 3-col card grids) rendered as static composites.

### Whitespace Philosophy
The gradient mesh occupies the upper third of the page; the white canvas below is generously padded. Section gaps tend toward 96px, with content tightening to 32px on dashboard / pricing pages where users compare and act.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/stripe/DESIGN.md","category":"layout"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 4),

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Flat | Default surface |

### Decorative Depth
The gradient mesh IS the depth system. Implemented as a layered SVG or large background image rather than CSS gradients (the actual mesh has organic blob shapes that aren''t CSS-renderable). The mesh provides the brand''s signature lift; literal shadows are reserved for product-UI mockups and stay subtle.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/stripe/DESIGN.md","category":"elevation"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 5),

### Photography Geometry
The brand uses **product UI mockups** more than photography. Dashboard composites render as faux IDE/terminal/dashboard chrome inside `{rounded.lg}` 12px containers with a subtle `box-shadow`. Real photography appears in customer logo strips and the rare case-study card; treated as inset 4:3 with no shadow.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/stripe/DESIGN.md","category":"shapes"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 6),

### Buttons

**`button-primary-pill`** — the dominant CTA system-wide.
- Background `{colors.primary}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.button-md}`, padding `{spacing.sm} {spacing.lg}` (8px 16px), rounded `{rounded.pill}` 9999px.
- Pressed state `button-primary-pill-pressed` shifts background to `{colors.primary-press}`.

**`button-secondary`** — outline-style alternative.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.primary}`, 1px solid `{colors.primary}` border, same pill geometry.

**`button-on-dark`** — used on dashboard / dark surfaces.
- Background `{colors.brand-dark-900}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, same pill geometry.

### Cards & Containers

**`card-feature-light`** — feature explanation card on white.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, padding `{spacing.xxl}`, rounded `{rounded.lg}` 12px, 1px `{colors.hairline}` border, optional Level 1 shadow.

**`card-pricing`** — standard pricing tier.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, padding `{spacing.xxl}`, rounded `{rounded.lg}`, 1px `{colors.hairline}` border. Title `{typography.heading-lg}`, price `{typography.display-md}`, body `{typography.body-md}`, CTA pinned bottom as `button-primary-pill`.

**`card-pricing-featured`** — the inverted dark featured tier.
- Background `{colors.brand-dark-900}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, otherwise identical structure to `card-pricing`. The deep-navy fill is the brand''s distinctive featured-tier choice.

**`card-cream-band`** — warm interlude card.
- Background `{colors.canvas-cream}`, text `{colors.ink}`, padding `{spacing.xxl}`, rounded `{rounded.lg}`. Used to break up the indigo / white rhythm with warmth.

**`card-dashboard-mockup`** — composited dashboard / product UI screenshot.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, type `{typography.body-tabular}` (with `tnum`), padding `{spacing.xl}` 24px, rounded `{rounded.lg}` 12px, Level 2 shadow. Often contains nested mini-mockups: code preview + dashboard table + chart card.

### Inputs & Forms

**`text-input`** — standard form field.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.body-md}`, padding `{spacing.sm} {spacing.md}` (8px 12px), rounded `{rounded.sm}` 6px, 1px `{colors.hairline-input}` border.
- Focus state `text-input-focused`: border swaps to `{colors.primary}`.

### Navigation

**`nav-bar-on-mesh`** — top nav floating over the gradient hero.
- Background `{colors.canvas}` (or transparent depending on scroll), text `{colors.ink}`, padding `{spacing.lg} {spacing.xl}`. Logo wordmark on the left, primary nav center, sign-in + filled `button-primary-pill` on the right.

### Pills, Tags, and Chips

**`pill-tag-soft`** — subdued indigo tag.
- Background `{colors.primary-bg-subdued-hover}`, text `{colors.primary-deep}`, type `{typography.micro-cap}`, padding `4px 8px`, rounded `{rounded.pill}`.

### Signature Components

**Gradient Mesh Backdrop** — pastel cream → sherbet orange → lavender → indigo → ruby pink stops blurred horizontally across the upper third of the page. Implemented as SVG or a large background image — not a flat CSS gradient (the real mesh has organic blob shapes).

**Composited Dashboard Mockup** — multi-layer faux-product-UI compositions: an IDE panel on the left, a dashboard table center, a chart card on the right, all rendered at small scale inside `{rounded.lg}` containers with subtle Level 2 shadows. The composite is the brand''s most-photographed feature.

**Tabular-Figure Money Type** — every number rendering money, count, or transaction value uses `font-feature-settings: "tnum"`. The brand''s quiet signal that it''s a financial-infrastructure platform.

**`link-on-light`** — inline links on light surfaces.
- Text `{colors.primary}` rendered in `{typography.body-md}`, no underline by default.

**`footer-light`** — site-wide footer.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink-mute}`, type `{typography.caption}`, padding `{spacing.huge} {spacing.xl}` (64px 24px). Holds 4–6 columns of link groups, social icons, and a small legal row.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/stripe/DESIGN.md","category":"components"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 7),
((select id from d), 'dos_and_donts', 'Do''s and Don''ts', 'dos_and_donts', '## Do''s and Don''ts

### Do
- Reserve `{colors.primary}` for filled CTAs and inline link emphasis — it should appear sparingly, one filled button per band.
- Apply the gradient mesh to every marketing hero; bare-canvas heroes feel off-brand.
- Render display tiers at weight 300 with negative letter-spacing — the thin tracking is the typographic signature.
- Use `font-feature-settings: "tnum"` on every money / numeric cell.
- Apply `font-feature-settings: "ss01"` globally on the body element.
- Pair every feature explanation with a composited product UI mockup; the brand''s argument is "look at the actual product."

### Don''t
- Don''t bump display weight above 300 — at 400 the brand''s editorial air collapses.
- Don''t add new accent colors outside the documented gradient stops (cream / orange / lavender / indigo / ruby / magenta).
- Don''t use the indigo `{colors.primary}` as a body-text color — it''s a CTA and link color, not a type color at body size.
- Don''t shrink button padding below `8px 16px` — the tight pill is part of the brand''s transactional feel.
- Don''t render money cells without `tnum` — it breaks the quiet financial-data signature.
- Don''t replace the pill shape with rounded-rectangles for buttons.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/stripe/DESIGN.md","category":"dos_and_donts"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 8),

### Breakpoints

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Wide | ≥ 1440px | Full gradient mesh edge-to-edge; dashboard composite at full scale |
| Desktop | 1024–1440px | Default content max-width; pricing 4-up |
| Tablet | 768–1023px | Pricing 2-up; dashboard composite simplifies to 2 panels |
| Mobile | < 768px | Pricing 1-up; hamburger nav; display drops 56 → 36px |

### Touch Targets
- Pill buttons hit ≥ 40×40px on mobile via padding scaling. On smaller screens, buttons size up to 44×44px to maintain WCAG AAA.
- Form fields stay at 40px minimum height.

### Collapsing Strategy
- Display tiers stair-step 56 → 48 → 32 → 26 → 22px through the breakpoints.
- Gradient mesh re-tiles on mobile to preserve the wash without disappearing.
- Dashboard composites simplify to single-panel mockups on mobile; the multi-layer composition only renders at desktop+.
- Pricing tiers stair-step 4-up → 2-up → 1-up.

### Image Behavior
Product UI composites use `srcset` with art-direction crops at major breakpoints. Mobile crops focus on the most actionable inner panel; desktop crops show the full multi-layer composition.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/stripe/DESIGN.md","category":"responsive_guidelines"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 9),

## Overview

Supabaze''s design language is engineered for clarity above all else. The marketing surfaces sit on `{colors.canvas}` (pure white), with text rendered in `{colors.ink}` (`#171717` — near-black, never pure black). Across the entire system the only consistent chromatic event is the **emerald green primary** (`{colors.primary}` — `#3ecf8e`) — used as the filled CTA, occasional accent dot, and the signature highlight color in the wordmark. Everything else is a calibrated grey ladder from `#ededed` hairline-cool to `#171717` ink, with thin black-on-white typography doing most of the visual work.

Typography runs **Circular** at weight 500 for display and 400 for body. The display tier uses tight negative letter-spacing (-1.92px at 64px) to pull the rounded humanist letterforms into editorial density. There''s no atmospheric gradient, no full-bleed photography, no dark-canvas marketing track — the brand commits to white.

The product itself appears as composited UI screenshots on every page: dashboard tables, SQL editors, query builders, log streams. These screenshots are the brand''s argument. They sit inside `{rounded.lg}` 12px containers with subtle 1px hairlines, often arranged 2-up or in a floating "stacked panes" composition above the hero band.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Single emerald primary (`{colors.primary}` `#3ecf8e`) as the only chromatic event; everything else is monochrome.
- White canvas marketing track with greyscale hierarchy from `{colors.hairline-cool}` to `{colors.ink}`.
- Custom humanist sans display tier at weight 500 with negative letter-spacing of -1.92px to -0.42px.
- Composited product UI screenshots (dashboard, SQL editor, log stream) are the dominant decorative element — never photography, never illustrations.
- Tight 6px / 8px button radii — square-ish, technical, never pill-shaped.
- Code blocks rendered in deep `{colors.canvas-night}` (`#1c1c1c`) with monospace inline code; the brand''s developer DNA is visible in every snippet.
- Pricing tiers use a dark inverted `{colors.canvas-night}` featured tier, not a green one — the green is reserved for buttons and dot accents.

## Colors

> **Source pages:** home (`/`), `/database`, `/partners/integrations`, `/partners/integrations/powersync`, `/solutions/ai-builders`, `/pricing`.

### Brand & Accent
- **Emerald** (`{colors.primary}` — `#3ecf8e`): The signature CTA color. Filled-button background, brand wordmark accent, dot indicator.
- **Emerald Deep** (`{colors.primary-deep}` — `#24b47e`): Pressed-state lift of the primary.
- **Emerald Soft** (`{colors.primary-soft}` — `#4ade80`): Lighter emerald used in chart accents and product UI.
- **Accent Purple** (`{colors.accent-purple}` — `#6b01c2`): Rare accent used in integration logos and chart points; never a button.
- **Accent Violet** (`{colors.accent-violet}` — `#644fc1`): Secondary accent in the same role as accent purple.
- **Accent Yellow** (`{colors.accent-yellow}` — `#ffdb13`): Chart accent / status indicator only.
- **Accent Pink / Crimson / Indigo / Tomato**: Reserved for integration logos and rare chart highlights, never as system colors.

### Surface
- **Canvas** (`{colors.canvas}` — `#ffffff`): Default page background.
- **Canvas Soft** (`{colors.canvas-soft}` — `#fafafa`): Barely-tinted off-white for alternating section bands.
- **Canvas Night** (`{colors.canvas-night}` — `#1c1c1c`): Deep near-black used in code blocks, dashboard mockups, featured pricing tier.
- **Canvas Night Soft** (`{colors.canvas-night-soft}` — `#202020`): Slightly lifted dark for nested chrome.
- **Hairline** (`{colors.hairline}` — `#dfdfdf`): 1px borders on cards and tables.
- **Hairline Strong** (`{colors.hairline-strong}` — `#c7c7c7`): Slightly darker border for emphasis.
- **Hairline Cool** (`{colors.hairline-cool}` — `#ededed`) / **Hairline Cool 2** (`#efefef`) / **Hairline Cool 3** (`#d4d4d4`): The brand''s grey ladder for fine chrome work.

### Text
- **Ink** (`{colors.ink}` — `#171717`): Default body text. Near-black, never pure.
- **Ink Secondary** (`{colors.ink-secondary}` — `#212121`): Slightly cooler near-black for body emphasis.
- **Ink Mute** (`{colors.ink-mute}` — `#707070`): Secondary text and helper copy.
- **Ink Mute 2** (`{colors.ink-mute-2}` — `#9a9a9a`): Tertiary text.
- **Ink Faint** (`{colors.ink-faint}` — `#b2b2b2`): Disabled / placeholder text.
- **On Primary** (`{colors.on-primary}` — `#171717`): Text on the emerald primary fill — near-black, not white. The button reads as a "lit" surface with dark type, not a colored chip.
- **On Dark** (`{colors.on-dark}` — `#ffffff`): Text on canvas-night surfaces.

## Typography

### Font Family

The display and UI tier is **Circular** — a proprietary geometric humanist sans by Lineto. Fallback chain: `''Helvetica Neue'', Helvetica, Arial`.

For maximum brand fidelity when Circular isn''t licensed, use **Inter** (open-source via Google Fonts) at weight 500 for display with `letter-spacing: -1.92px` at 64px. Inter is the closest open-source analogue to Circular''s geometric humanist character.

Code blocks use **system mono** (`ui-monospace`, with Menlo / Monaco / Consolas fallbacks).

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-xxl}` | 64px | 500 | 1.1 | -1.92px | Hero headline |
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 48px | 500 | 1.1 | -1.44px | Section opener |
| `{typography.display-lg}` | 36px | 500 | 1.15 | -0.72px | Sub-section / pricing tier |
| `{typography.display-md}` | 28px | 500 | 1.2 | -0.42px | Card title |
| `{typography.heading-lg}` | 22px | 500 | 1.2 | 0 | Compact heading |
| `{typography.heading-md}` | 18px | 500 | 1.4 | 0 | Section sub-heading |
| `{typography.body-lg}` | 18px | 400 | 1.55 | 0 | Marketing body lead |
| `{typography.body-md}` | 16px | 400 | 1.5 | 0 | Default UI body |
| `{typography.button-md}` | 14px | 500 | 1.0 | 0 | Button label |
| `{typography.caption}` | 13px | 400 | 1.45 | 0 | Helper, footnote |
| `{typography.micro}` | 12px | 400 | 1.45 | 0 | Pill label, fine print |
| `{typography.code}` | 14px | 400 | 1.5 | 0 | Code block content |

### Principles
- **Weight 500 across display.** Mid-weight reads as engineered, not decorative.
- **Negative tracking on display.** -1.92px at 64px scaling proportionally down — tightens the rounded humanist letterforms into editorial density.
- **Mono for code.** System mono families (Menlo / Monaco) — no proprietary mono webfont.

### Note on Font Substitutes
Circular is proprietary. Use **Inter** at weight 500 with `letter-spacing: -1.92px` for display tiers. **Geist Sans** (open-source from Vercel) is another close alternative for both display and body. Avoid Helvetica defaults — they''re heavier and lack the geometric warmth.

## Layout

### Spacing System
- **Base unit**: 8px (with 2 / 4 / 12 sub-tokens for fine work).
- **Tokens**: `{spacing.xxs}` 2px · `{spacing.xs}` 4px · `{spacing.sm}` 8px · `{spacing.md}` 12px · `{spacing.lg}` 16px · `{spacing.xl}` 24px · `{spacing.xxl}` 32px · `{spacing.huge}` 64px.
- **Section padding**: 64–96px on marketing surfaces.
- **Card internal padding**: 32px on feature/pricing cards.

### Grid & Container
- Marketing pages center in a ~1280px container with no edge-bleed; the brand keeps content inside the box.
- Pricing collapses 4-up → 2-up → 1-up at 1024 / 768 breakpoints.
- Product UI mockups stack 2-up or render as overlapping panes inside the same container.

### Whitespace Philosophy
The brand uses generous 64–96px section padding without atmospheric gradients filling the space — the white canvas is the design. The composited product UI mockups break up sections without requiring decoration.

## Elevation & Depth

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Flat, 1px hairline | Default cards |
| 1 | `box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)` | Subtle card lift |
| 2 | `box-shadow: 0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)` | Floating composited UI mockups |
| 3 | `box-shadow: 0 16px 48px rgba(0,0,0,0.12)` | Modal overlays, deep elevation |

### Decorative Depth
The brand''s depth is **product UI mockups** rather than gradients. Stacked dashboard / SQL editor / log panes composite together with subtle Level 2 shadows to suggest spatial hierarchy.

## Shapes

### Border Radius Scale

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{rounded.xs}` | 4px | Form inputs, hairline tags |
| `{rounded.sm}` | 6px | Buttons (the brand''s signature button radius), code blocks |
| `{rounded.md}` | 8px | Compact cards, alerts |
| `{rounded.lg}` | 12px | Pricing cards, feature cards, product mockups |
| `{rounded.xl}` | 16px | Modal dialogs, large container chrome |
| `{rounded.full}` | 9999px | Pill tags, avatars |

### Photography Geometry
The brand uses minimal photography. Customer logo strips display wordmarks at uniform height (~24–32px) in greyscale; case-study cards (rare) use 4:3 photos inset in `{rounded.lg}` containers.

## Components

### Buttons

**`button-primary-green`** — the signature CTA.
- Background `{colors.primary}`, text `{colors.on-primary}` (near-black, NOT white), type `{typography.button-md}`, padding `{spacing.sm} {spacing.lg}` (8px 16px), rounded `{rounded.sm}` 6px.
- Pressed state `button-primary-green-pressed` shifts to `{colors.primary-deep}`.

**`button-secondary-outline`** — outline alternative on white.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, 1px solid `{colors.hairline-strong}` border, same shape.

**`button-on-dark`** — used on dark surfaces / code-block CTAs.
- Background `{colors.canvas-night}`, text `{colors.on-dark}`, same shape.

**`button-link`** — text-only inline button.
- Transparent background, text `{colors.ink}` rendered in `{typography.button-md}`, no padding, with a subtle underline on hover.

### Cards & Containers

**`card-feature-light`** — feature card on white.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, padding `{spacing.xxl}`, rounded `{rounded.lg}` 12px, 1px `{colors.hairline}` border.

**`card-pricing`** — standard pricing tier.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, padding `{spacing.xxl}`, rounded `{rounded.lg}`, 1px `{colors.hairline}` border. Title in `{typography.heading-lg}`, price in `{typography.display-md}`, body in `{typography.body-md}`, CTA `button-primary-green` pinned bottom.

**`card-pricing-featured`** — inverted dark featured tier.
- Background `{colors.canvas-night}`, text `{colors.on-dark}`, otherwise identical structure.

**`card-feature-dark`** — feature card with deep dark fill.
- Background `{colors.canvas-night}`, text `{colors.on-dark}`, padding `{spacing.xxl}`, rounded `{rounded.lg}`. Used for code-heavy feature explanations.

**`code-block`** — code snippet container.
- Background `{colors.canvas-night}`, text `{colors.on-dark}` rendered in `{typography.code}`. Padding `{spacing.lg}` 16px, rounded `{rounded.sm}` 6px.

### Inputs & Forms

**`text-input`** — standard form input.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.body-md}`, padding `{spacing.sm} {spacing.md}` (8px 12px), rounded `{rounded.sm}` 6px, 1px `{colors.hairline}` border.

### Navigation

**`nav-bar-light`** — top nav across the site.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, padding `{spacing.lg} {spacing.xl}`. Logo on the left, primary nav center, "Sign In" link + filled `button-primary-green` on the right.

### Pills, Tags, and Chips

**`pill-tag-green`** — small green pill used for "new" or featured indicators.
- Background `{colors.primary}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.micro}`, padding `{spacing.xxs} {spacing.sm}`, rounded `{rounded.full}`.

**`pill-tag-soft`** — neutral pill on light surfaces.
- Background `{colors.canvas-soft}`, text `{colors.ink}`, otherwise same shape.

### Signature Components

**Composited Product UI Mockups** — multi-layer dashboard / SQL editor / log pane composites with subtle Level 2 shadows. The product is the brand''s argument; mockups always sit on white canvas with no surrounding decoration.

**`link-on-light`** — inline links in body copy.
- Text `{colors.ink}` rendered in `{typography.body-md}` with a persistent underline.

**`footer-light`** — site-wide footer.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink-mute}`, type `{typography.caption}`, padding `{spacing.huge} {spacing.xl}` (64px 24px). Holds 4–5 columns of link groups, social icons, and a small legal row.

## Do''s and Don''ts

### Do
- Reserve `{colors.primary}` emerald for filled CTAs and the wordmark accent — it should appear sparingly.
- Render display tiers at weight 500 with negative letter-spacing — the engineered tightness is part of the brand.
- Use `{rounded.sm}` 6px for buttons — square-ish radii, never pill-shaped.
- Composite product UI mockups inside `{rounded.lg}` containers with subtle Level 2 shadows.
- Use near-black `{colors.ink}` on the emerald button (not white) — the green reads as "lit" with dark type, which is the brand''s idiosyncratic choice.
- Apply system mono for every code block.

### Don''t
- Don''t introduce additional accent colors as system colors — purples, yellows, and pinks belong inside chart points and integration logos only.
- Don''t bump display weight above 500 — the brand''s calibrated mid-weight breaks at 600+.
- Don''t use pill-shaped buttons; the brand''s button radius is square-ish 6px.
- Don''t use white text on the emerald button — the brand specifically uses near-black on green.
- Don''t add atmospheric gradients to hero bands — the white canvas is the design.

## Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Wide | ≥ 1440px | Full container width; product mockups at full scale |
| Desktop | 1024–1440px | Default content max-width; pricing 4-up |
| Tablet | 768–1023px | Pricing 2-up; mockups simplify to single panel |
| Mobile | < 768px | Pricing 1-up; hamburger nav; display drops 64 → 36px |

### Touch Targets
- Buttons hit ≥ 36×36px on mobile; vertical padding scales up to maintain WCAG AA minimum.
- Form fields stay at 36px minimum height.

### Collapsing Strategy
- Display tiers stair-step 64 → 48 → 36 → 28 → 22px.
- Product UI mockups simplify to a single primary panel on mobile.
- Pricing tiers stair-step 4-up → 2-up → 1-up; dark featured tier always distinguished.

### Image Behavior
Product UI mockups use `srcset` with desktop / mobile crops; mobile crops focus on the most actionable inner panel.

## Iteration Guide

1. Focus on ONE component at a time.
2. Reference component names and tokens directly.
3. Run `npx @google/design.md lint DESIGN.md` after edits.
4. Default body to `{typography.body-md}`; use `{typography.code}` for any developer-facing snippet.
5. Keep emerald scarce; one filled green button per viewport.
6. The white-canvas commitment is non-negotiable — adding atmospheric backdrops breaks the brand.

### Photography Geometry
The brand uses minimal photography. Customer logo strips display wordmarks at uniform height (~24–32px) in greyscale; case-study cards (rare) use 4:3 photos inset in `{rounded.lg}` containers.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/supabase/DESIGN.md","category":"shapes"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 6),

### Buttons

**`button-primary-green`** — the signature CTA.
- Background `{colors.primary}`, text `{colors.on-primary}` (near-black, NOT white), type `{typography.button-md}`, padding `{spacing.sm} {spacing.lg}` (8px 16px), rounded `{rounded.sm}` 6px.
- Pressed state `button-primary-green-pressed` shifts to `{colors.primary-deep}`.

**`button-secondary-outline`** — outline alternative on white.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, 1px solid `{colors.hairline-strong}` border, same shape.

**`button-on-dark`** — used on dark surfaces / code-block CTAs.
- Background `{colors.canvas-night}`, text `{colors.on-dark}`, same shape.

**`button-link`** — text-only inline button.
- Transparent background, text `{colors.ink}` rendered in `{typography.button-md}`, no padding, with a subtle underline on hover.

### Cards & Containers

**`card-feature-light`** — feature card on white.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, padding `{spacing.xxl}`, rounded `{rounded.lg}` 12px, 1px `{colors.hairline}` border.

**`card-pricing`** — standard pricing tier.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, padding `{spacing.xxl}`, rounded `{rounded.lg}`, 1px `{colors.hairline}` border. Title in `{typography.heading-lg}`, price in `{typography.display-md}`, body in `{typography.body-md}`, CTA `button-primary-green` pinned bottom.

**`card-pricing-featured`** — inverted dark featured tier.
- Background `{colors.canvas-night}`, text `{colors.on-dark}`, otherwise identical structure.

**`card-feature-dark`** — feature card with deep dark fill.
- Background `{colors.canvas-night}`, text `{colors.on-dark}`, padding `{spacing.xxl}`, rounded `{rounded.lg}`. Used for code-heavy feature explanations.

**`code-block`** — code snippet container.
- Background `{colors.canvas-night}`, text `{colors.on-dark}` rendered in `{typography.code}`. Padding `{spacing.lg}` 16px, rounded `{rounded.sm}` 6px.

### Inputs & Forms

**`text-input`** — standard form input.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.body-md}`, padding `{spacing.sm} {spacing.md}` (8px 12px), rounded `{rounded.sm}` 6px, 1px `{colors.hairline}` border.

### Navigation

**`nav-bar-light`** — top nav across the site.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, padding `{spacing.lg} {spacing.xl}`. Logo on the left, primary nav center, "Sign In" link + filled `button-primary-green` on the right.

### Pills, Tags, and Chips

**`pill-tag-green`** — small green pill used for "new" or featured indicators.
- Background `{colors.primary}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.micro}`, padding `{spacing.xxs} {spacing.sm}`, rounded `{rounded.full}`.

**`pill-tag-soft`** — neutral pill on light surfaces.
- Background `{colors.canvas-soft}`, text `{colors.ink}`, otherwise same shape.

### Signature Components

**Composited Product UI Mockups** — multi-layer dashboard / SQL editor / log pane composites with subtle Level 2 shadows. The product is the brand''s argument; mockups always sit on white canvas with no surrounding decoration.

**`link-on-light`** — inline links in body copy.
- Text `{colors.ink}` rendered in `{typography.body-md}` with a persistent underline.

**`footer-light`** — site-wide footer.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink-mute}`, type `{typography.caption}`, padding `{spacing.huge} {spacing.xl}` (64px 24px). Holds 4–5 columns of link groups, social icons, and a small legal row.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/supabase/DESIGN.md","category":"components"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 7),

### Do
- Reserve `{colors.primary}` emerald for filled CTAs and the wordmark accent — it should appear sparingly.
- Render display tiers at weight 500 with negative letter-spacing — the engineered tightness is part of the brand.
- Use `{rounded.sm}` 6px for buttons — square-ish radii, never pill-shaped.
- Composite product UI mockups inside `{rounded.lg}` containers with subtle Level 2 shadows.
- Use near-black `{colors.ink}` on the emerald button (not white) — the green reads as "lit" with dark type, which is the brand''s idiosyncratic choice.
- Apply system mono for every code block.

### Don''t
- Don''t introduce additional accent colors as system colors — purples, yellows, and pinks belong inside chart points and integration logos only.
- Don''t bump display weight above 500 — the brand''s calibrated mid-weight breaks at 600+.
- Don''t use pill-shaped buttons; the brand''s button radius is square-ish 6px.
- Don''t use white text on the emerald button — the brand specifically uses near-black on green.
- Don''t add atmospheric gradients to hero bands — the white canvas is the design.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/supabase/DESIGN.md","category":"dos_and_donts"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 8),

### Breakpoints

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Wide | ≥ 1440px | Full container width; product mockups at full scale |
| Desktop | 1024–1440px | Default content max-width; pricing 4-up |
| Tablet | 768–1023px | Pricing 2-up; mockups simplify to single panel |
| Mobile | < 768px | Pricing 1-up; hamburger nav; display drops 64 → 36px |

### Touch Targets
- Buttons hit ≥ 36×36px on mobile; vertical padding scales up to maintain WCAG AA minimum.
- Form fields stay at 36px minimum height.

### Collapsing Strategy
- Display tiers stair-step 64 → 48 → 36 → 28 → 22px.
- Product UI mockups simplify to a single primary panel on mobile.
- Pricing tiers stair-step 4-up → 2-up → 1-up; dark featured tier always distinguished.

### Image Behavior
Product UI mockups use `srcset` with desktop / mobile crops; mobile crops focus on the most actionable inner panel.', '{"sourcePath":"docs/design-md/supabase/DESIGN.md","category":"responsive_guidelines"}'::jsonb, 0.75, 9),

2. Reference component names and tokens directly.
3. Run `npx @google/design.md lint DESIGN.md` after edits.
4. Default body to `{typography.body-md}`; use `{typography.code}` for any developer-facing snippet.
